EV/EBITDA of 3.37 confirms it is a classic deep value 'cigar butt' or overlooked net-net style play.\n2. CROX: Insiders (Director, CFO) bought stock in Aug/Nov 2025 around $75 range. Current price ~$89. Forward PE of 7.5x implies the market is pricing in zero growth or decline, while recent insider activity suggests confidence.\n3. STLA: Trading at 0.4x Book Value and offering ~6.5% dividend yield. While the auto cycle is tough, the valuation offers a massive buffer against bad news."
