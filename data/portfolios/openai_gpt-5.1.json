            "notes": "Key data and conclusions from today\u2019s research:\n\n1) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price: $497.23; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (trading ~8% below high, well above low).\n- Valuation/quality: TTM P/E \u2248 15.9; profit margin \u2248 18%; ROE \u2248 10%; ROA \u2248 4.8%; very strong balance sheet (current ratio ~2.7, conservative leverage).\n- 1\u2011year price history: Steady uptrend with moderate volatility; essentially a compounding vehicle that mirrors growth in intrinsic value.\n- Insider activity: Buffett\u2019s regular large stock gifts (charity) and minimal selling by other insiders; no negative signal.\n- Analyst stance: Light coverage; mix of Buy/Hold, no major red flags.\n- Interpretation: High\u2011quality, diversified compounding machine trading at a roughly fair (mid\u2011teens) multiple versus an expensive market. Not a screaming bargain but a robust, low\u2011risk core holding with implicit margin of safety via its underlying cash\u2011generative subsidiaries and large cash pile.\n\n2) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Price: $25.77; 52w range: $20.92\u2013$27.69.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 15.0; forward P/E \u2248 8.8; P/B \u2248 1.6; P/S \u2248 2.3; EV/EBITDA \u2248 8.0.\n- Profitability/quality: Profit margin \u2248 15.7%; ROE \u2248 10.6%; ROA \u2248 5.2%; debt\u2011to\u2011equity \u2248 66%; current ratio ~1.3. Solid, not over\u2011levered.\n- Dividend: Yield \u2248 6.6%, well\u2011covered by forward earnings based on the low forward P/E, though subject to drug-cycle volatility.\n- Price action (1y): Stock sank into low\u201120s amid post\u2011COVID revenue normalization concerns and has since recovered into mid\u201120s; still below prior cycle highs.\n- Insider activity: Many stock/option exercises (neutral), but notably a director purchased ~19,457 shares around $25.65 (~$0.5M) in Feb 2025, a positive alignment signal at roughly today\u2019s price.\n- Analyst recommendations: Recent consensus skewed to Hold/Buy (roughly 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell). Street sees value but with execution risk.\n- Thesis: Large, diversified pharma with durable cash flows trading at a single\u2011digit forward P/E and a >6% dividend yield. Market is pricing in a significant decline in COVID\u2011related earnings and pipeline/regulatory risk. Even under conservative assumptions for lower earnings, the combination of yield plus modest growth offers an attractive total\u2011return profile. Margin of safety comes from the low forward multiple, diversified portfolio, and balance sheet.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Price: $24.84; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 8.1; forward P/E \u2248 11.1; P/B \u2248 1.6; P/S \u2248 1.4; EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.6.\n- Profitability/quality: Profit margin \u2248 17.9%; ROE \u2248 19.1%; ROA \u2248 4.0%; debt\u2011to\u2011equity \u2248 124% (high but typical for telecom), current ratio \u2248 1.0, quick ratio \u2248 0.7.\n- Dividend: Yield \u2248 4.4%. Payout appears covered by earnings and free cash flow after prior reset, but leverage and capex requirements remain key risks.\n- Price action (1y): Strong recovery from low\u201120s to high\u201120s, then consolidation in mid\u201120s. Market is no longer in panic but still ascribes a low multiple versus market due to leverage and secular worries.\n- Insider activity: Recent stock awards to CEO/CFO/other execs around $24\u201326; no large open\u2011market selling; largely neutral to mildly positive.\n- Analyst recommendations: Currently 4 strong buy, 13 buy, 8 hold, no sells \u2013 a broadly constructive stance.\n- Thesis: Boring, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom that has de\u2011risked vs prior years (asset sales, dividend right\u2011sizing) yet still trades at a depressed earnings multiple. With even modest execution on deleveraging and steady wireless service revenue, investors are paid a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield to wait, with potential for re\u2011rating toward a low\u2011teens multiple. Margin of safety comes from low valuation and recurring cash flows, offset by elevated debt risk.\n\nPortfolio & market context:\n- With BRK-B at a fair (not cheap) multiple, and PFE/T still on clear value multiples with income, a barbelled approach \u2013 one high\u2011quality compounding core plus two higher\u2011yield, more contrarian names \u2013 balances quality and upside.\n- Overall market, judging by BRK-B and JPM trading near highs at mid\u2011teens P/Es, appears fairly valued to expensive. The better risk/reward seems in specific underappreciated cash\u2011generative names rather than broad index\u2011like exposure."

            "notes": "Key updates as of 2025\u201112\u201111:\n\n1) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Price / performance: ~$25.78 vs our entry at $25.77 (roughly flat). Trading between its 52\u2011week low $20.92 and high $27.69, currently in the upper half but still below the recent spike highs.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 15.0; forward P/E \u2248 8.4; P/B \u2248 1.58; P/S \u2248 2.33; EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.9. Dividend yield \u2248 6.7%. These are essentially unchanged from our initial work and still imply the market is pricing in a significant earnings step\u2011down.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 15.7%, ROE \u2248 10.6%, ROA \u2248 5.2%. Debt\u2011to\u2011equity \u2248 66%, current ratio \u2248 1.28. No sign of new balance\u2011sheet stress.\n- Price action (1y): The chart shows a large leg down into the low\u201120s in spring 2025, then a strong grind higher into the mid\u201120s and a spike above $26 in October. Since then the stock has been consolidating in the mid\u201120s. That\u2019s consistent with the market digesting post\u2011COVID reset news rather than a fresh negative development.\n- Insider activity: Recent items are mostly option exercises and stock awards for executives, plus a small officer sale (~2,500 shares at ~$25.93). The notably positive February 2025 open\u2011market director purchase around $25.65 remains a strong reference point near today\u2019s price, and there\u2019s been no wave of selling around current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest recommendation snapshot is stable: 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell. No evidence of a sudden downgrade cycle.\n- Interpretation: Our original thesis (single\u2011digit forward P/E on a large, diversified pharma with a covered high yield) remains intact. The business and valuation profile are essentially unchanged, and the stock has merely churned around our entry. Margin of safety looks adequate; no reason to trim or add based solely on today\u2019s information.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price / performance: ~$24.39 vs our entry at $24.84 (down ~2%). 52\u2011week range $21.38\u2013$29.79; current price is well off the highs, closer to mid\u2011range.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 7.9; forward P/E \u2248 10.9; P/B \u2248 1.57; P/S \u2248 1.40; EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.46. Dividend yield \u2248 4.6%. Still a classic low\u2011multiple, income\u2011oriented telecom profile.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 17.9%, ROE \u2248 19.1%, ROA \u2248 4.0%. Debt\u2011to\u2011equity remains high at \u2248124%, with current ratio \u22481.0 and quick ratio \u22480.71. This is consistent with our prior work: leverage is elevated but not newly alarming.\n- Price action (1y): Strong rally from low\u201120s to high\u201120s through mid\u2011year, followed by a pullback into the mid\u201120s and then a further drift down to the mid\u2011$24s recently. The move down from ~29 suggests optimism cooled, but the stock is not in a new panic phase.\n- Insider activity: Recent transactions are largely stock awards and gifts to executives at prices in the mid\u201120s. No big open\u2011market insider selling. That\u2019s neutral to mildly positive (compensation aligned near today\u2019s price level).\n- Street sentiment: Very constructive: 4 strong buy, 13 buy, 8 hold, 0 sell. This pattern is unchanged month\u2011over\u2011month.\n- Interpretation: T still offers an 8x trailing / low\u2011teens forward P/E on a stable, capital\u2011intensive business with a right\u2011sized dividend. The share price has eased a bit since our entry but not enough to justify materially increasing an already sizeable telecom allocation. Thesis (stable cash flows + deleveraging + potential modest re\u2011rating) remains intact; risk still centered on leverage rather than valuation.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price / performance: ~$490.43 vs our entry at $497.23 (down ~1\u20132%). 52\u2011week range $440.10\u2013$542.07; current price is slightly below the mid\u2011point of that range and ~10% below the high.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 15.7; forward P/E \u2248 20.3 (the latter is noisy given the nature of reported earnings). P/S \u2248 2.84. P/B is reported around 0.001 due to accounting quirks in the dataset, but we know from prior analysis that Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book. EV/EBITDA is not meaningful because of the conglomerate structure and large cash/marketable securities position.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 18%, ROE \u2248 10.2%, ROA \u2248 4.8%. Current ratio \u2248 2.7 with very low debt\u2011to\u2011equity \u224818%. This is still a fortress balance sheet.\n- Price action (1y): A steady climb into the low\u2011500s, a spike to all\u2011time highs above $540 in May, then a pullback into the high\u2011400s/low\u2011500s where it\u2019s been trading in a relatively tight range. No sign of structural breakdown; just consolidation after a strong run.\n- Insider activity: As usual, activity is dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring stock gifts to charities and board members; Ajit Jain has some occasional sales and small gifts. No insider buys, but this is longstanding behavior and not new information.\n- Street sentiment: Light coverage: current snapshot shows 0 strong buys, 2 buys, 2 holds, 0 sells. Analysts broadly see Berkshire as a high\u2011quality, fairly\u2011valued compounder.\n- Interpretation: Berkshire still looks like a high\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle trading at roughly a fair multiple in a market that is not obviously cheap. It remains appropriate as our quality anchor rather than a deep value opportunity.\n\n4) Portfolio & market context\n- Portfolio structure (approximate): PFE ~$3.5k, T ~$2.95k, BRK\u2011B ~$2.47k, plus roughly ~$1k cash based on our initial allocations. That\u2019s a concentrated three\u2011stock portfolio with meaningful exposure to healthcare (PFE), telecom/infrastructure (T), and a diversified conglomerate (BRK\u2011B).\n- Relative valuations: PFE and T continue to trade on clear value multiples vs. the overall market (single\u2011digit to low\u2011teens forward P/Es and high, covered yields). Berkshire, at ~16x trailing earnings near mid\u2011range of its 52\u2011week band, suggests the broad large\u2011cap market is priced at fair to somewhat rich levels rather than distressed.\n- No new red\u2011flag developments: Across the three names, fundamentals, insider behavior, and analyst stance show stability. Recent price moves are modest and consistent with normal volatility.\n- Cash as optionality: With the market broadly at fair valuations and no new, thoroughly\u2011researched high\u2011conviction idea in hand today, it is rational within a value\u2011investing framework to keep the residual cash uncommitted and wait for a more obvious dislocation.\n"

No sign of thesis\u2011changing news.\n- Assessment: Large, diversified pharma still priced at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a ~6.7% dividend yield and stable fundamentals. Thesis and margin of safety remain intact; sizing is already meaningful, so we hold but don\u2019t add on a flat tape.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price: ~$24.30; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79 (well below the high, modestly above the low).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E ~7.9; forward P/E ~10.9; P/B ~1.56; P/S ~1.40; EV/EBITDA ~7.45; dividend yield ~4.6%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%. Leverage still high: debt/equity ~124%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71.\n- 1\u2011month price action: Drift from mid\u2011$25s down into the low\u2011$24s; a mild pullback rather than a capitulation.\n- Insider/Street: Recent activity mostly stock awards and stock gifts at prices around mid\u201120s; no notable insider selling. Analyst consensus still very favorable (4 strong buy, 13 buy, 8 hold, no sells).\n- Assessment: Remains a classic low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011generative but leveraged telecom. Our existing position size is substantial; current pullback is not large enough versus risk (leverage) to justify increasing exposure. Thesis unchanged; continue to hold.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price: ~$495.85; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (around the middle of the range).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E ~15.8; forward P/E ~20.5 (noisy); P/S ~2.87; EV/EBITDA metric is not very meaningful due to the conglomerate structure and large cash/securities portfolio.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55. This remains a very strong balance sheet.\n- 1\u2011month price action: Gradual softening from low\u2011$510s to high\u2011$490s, with no sharp breaks.\n- Insider/Street: As usual, insider tape shows Buffett\u2019s periodic large stock gifts and small Ajit Jain sales earlier in the year; nothing new and out of pattern. Analyst coverage is light and stable (roughly 2 buys, 2 holds).\n- Assessment: High\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle trading at a fair \u2013 but not obviously cheap \u2013 multiple. Still appropriate as our portfolio\u2019s quality anchor; not compelling enough on valuation to increase.\n\n4) New idea scan & market color\n- Screened for US stocks with market cap roughly mid/small, P/E 3\u201312, and ROE >=8. Returned a mix of large, widely\u2011followed names (e.g., PG, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, XOM, JPM, BRK-B), plus existing positions (PFE, T) and some other value\u2011tilted names (VZ, MMM, WBA, etc.). This suggests the opportunity set is not overflowing with clearly mispriced quality small caps under our simple filters.\n- WBA: Tool returned nulls for price and ratios today, limiting our ability to analyze it quantitatively in this framework.\n- MMM: Current data show price ~$168.6, near a 52w high of ~$174.7; TTM P/E ~26.9, forward P/E ~19.5, P/B ~19.4, EV/EBITDA ~15.8, dividend yield ~1.7%. That profile is more \u2018quality at a full price\u2019 than \u2018value with margin of safety\u2019, especially given known legal/legacy overhangs.\n- Market proxy via BRK\u2011B and MMM: A high\u2011quality conglomerate at ~16x earnings and an industrial blue chip at high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/E both near the mid\u2011to\u2011upper parts of their ranges indicate a broadly fair\u2011to\u2011expensive large\u2011cap market rather than a deep value environment.\n\n5) Portfolio positioning takeaways\n- Three\u2011stock core remains: PFE (value + yield in healthcare), T (value + yield in telecom), BRK-B (quality compounder anchor).\n- Estimated cash of about 10% (given $10k start and current equity values) provides optionality.\n- No position shows fundamental deterioration or a valuation that has become obviously stretched on the upside.\n- No newly identified candidate today offers a clearly better risk/reward or larger margin of safety than our current holdings at current prices.\n\nConclusion: Maintain all three positions and keep cash uncommitted for now, consistent with a patient, margin\u2011of\u2011safety\u2011driven value approach."

Not expensive enough to trim, not cheap enough (relative to our existing size) to justify materially adding.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: $24.31; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79 (well below high, closer to middle of range).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E \u2248 7.9; forward P/E \u2248 10.9.\n  \u2022 P/B \u2248 1.56; P/S \u2248 1.40; EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.45.\n  \u2022 Dividend yield \u2248 4.6%.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin \u2248 17.9%; ROE \u2248 19.1%; ROA \u2248 4.0%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity \u2248 124%; current ratio \u2248 1.01; quick ratio \u2248 0.71.\n  \u2192 Classic leveraged telecom: strong recurring cash flows but high leverage and ongoing capex needs.\n- Recent price action (1 month):\n  \u2022 Drifted from mid\u2011$25s into low\u2011$24s; a controlled pullback, not a capitulation.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 Numerous stock awards to CEO/CFO/other executives at prices around $24.75\u2013$26.02.\n  \u2022 Some stock gifts from senior executives; no notable open\u2011market selling.\n  \u2192 Neutral to mildly positive; comp aligned near today\u2019s prices.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Latest recs: strong buy 4, buy 12, hold 9, no sells.

Given existing meaningful position, risk from adding (concentrated exposure to a highly leveraged telecom) is not justified by only a modest discount vs our entry.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: $506.38; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (around the middle but closer to upper half).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E \u2248 16.2; forward P/E \u2248 20.9 (noisy, given conglomerate accounting).\n  \u2022 P/S \u2248 2.94; P/B in dataset is distorted by accounting quirks, but qualitatively Berkshire usually trades at a modest premium to book.\n  \u2022 No dividend; total return via compounding of intrinsic value and buybacks.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin \u2248 18.1%; ROE \u2248 10.2%; ROA \u2248 4.8%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity \u2248 18.2%; current ratio \u2248 2.72; quick \u2248 2.55.\n  \u2192 Fortress balance sheet and high\u2011quality, diversified earnings base.\n- Recent price action (1 month):\n  \u2022 Traded mostly in the high $490s to low $500s; modest recovery from sub\u2011$500 levels, but still below the $542 high.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 Warren Buffett continues his regular large stock gifts to charities (multi\u2011million\u2011share gifts at $0 value in filings) \u2013 longstanding pattern.\n  \u2022 Ajit Jain occasional small stock gifts and an earlier sale (~15,000 shares @ ~$500 and 2,000 @ ~$465 in prior months).\n  \u2192 No unusual insider buying or selling; behavior consistent with long\u2011term patterns.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Recs: strong buy 0, buy 2, hold 2, sell 0 (light coverage, stable vs prior months).\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: high\u2011quality, diversified compounding machine at a fair mid\u2011teens P/E, serving as portfolio\u2019s quality anchor and implicit market proxy in a fairly\u2011to\u2011fully valued market.\n  \u2022 Today\u2019s valuation (~16x) and position in the 52w range still look like \u201cfair value\u201d rather than a screaming bargain or bubble.\n  \u2192 Continue to hold as a core, low\u2011risk anchor; not cheap enough to justify overweighting.\n\n5) Market conditions & new idea scan\n- Market read via BRK\u2011B and screened names:\n  \u2022 Berkshire at ~16x earnings in the mid\u2011upper part of its 52w range suggests a broad large\u2011cap market that is fairly to somewhat richly valued, not distressed.\n  \u2022 Our value screen (US, market cap $0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u22658) again surfaced a mix of large, well\u2011known names and a few others: [\"CSWI\", \"BRK\u2011B\", \"JPM\", \"CVX\", \"PG\", \"JNJ\", \"HD\", \"BAC\", \"XOM\", \"UNH\", \"INTC\", \"T\", \"VZ\", \"PFE\", \"WBA\", \"MMM\", \"KO\", \"PEP\", \"MCD\", \"WMT\", \"COST\", \"TGT\", \"LOW\", \"DIS\", \"NFLX\"].\n  \u2022 Many of these are quality franchises but are broadly followed and, in most cases, not obvious deep\u2011value outliers at today\u2019s prices.\n- Attempted new idea: CSWI (CSW Industrials)\n  \u2022 Tools returned null/empty data for price, ratios, financials, price history, insider activity, and recommendations.\n  \u2022 Without reliable basic data, I cannot responsibly underwrite a value thesis or size a position.\n- Other screened ideas:\n  \u2022 MMM: previously checked; currently trades near 52w highs on a high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/E, with known legal/legacy risks \u2013 more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than a margin\u2011of\u2011safety value idea.\n  \u2022 WBA: earlier data were incomplete/erratic; current tools again show issues for some tickers, limiting comfort.\n  \u2022 VZ: telecom peer to T; also value\u2011ish, but adding would further concentrate us in leveraged U.S. telecom without clearly superior risk/return vs T.\n  \u2192 Net: Today\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t reveal a clearly superior, under\u2011followed small/mid\u2011cap value idea with sufficient data to justify deployment of our ~9% cash.\n\n6) Portfolio positioning conclusions\n- PFE: still a large, diversified pharma at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a ~6.5% covered yield, modestly above our entry but firmly in value territory. Fundamentals and sentiment stable; insider behavior benign. Hold.\n- T: low\u2011P/E, high\u2011yield telecom with elevated leverage but stable cash flows. Price a bit below our entry, but not enough margin of safety to justify further concentration. Hold.\n- BRK\u2011B: high\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle at a fair ~16x multiple. Ideal quality anchor; not a deep value candidate for additional buying. Hold.\n- Cash (~9%): With no new name clearly superior to our existing holdings or clearly mispriced today, cash remains valuable optionality. Within a value\u2011investing framework, it is better to wait for a fat pitch than to dilute portfolio quality and margin of safety.\n\nDecision: No changes to existing positions today and no new positions initiated. Continue to monitor for dislocations, particularly in smaller, less\u2011followed names once reliable data are available."

            "notes": "1) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Price & valuation: Current price ~$25.53 (down from ~$26.43 on 12-16), 52w range $20.92\u2013$27.69. Trailing P/E ~14.84, forward P/E ~8.41, P/B ~1.56, P/S ~2.31, EV/EBITDA ~7.9. Dividend yield ~6.7%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~15.7%, ROE ~10.6%, ROA ~5.2%. Debt/equity ~66.5%, current ratio ~1.28, quick ratio ~0.90. Still a solid, moderately levered large-cap pharma.\n- Price action (1 month): Mostly a grind in the mid-$25s to low-$26s, with a push to $26.43 and then a drop to $25.53 on heavier volume on 12-16. Volatility is elevated but there is no tool-based evidence of a thesis-changing event.\n- Insider activity: Recent tape dominated by stock/option exercises and stock awards at higher historical strike prices (around $30\u201331), plus one small officer sale (~2,500 shares @ ~$25.93). The notable open-market director purchase from Feb 2025 (19,457 shares @ ~$25.65, roughly $0.5M) remains a strong positive reference level near today\u2019s price. No wave of insider selling around current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest snapshot (0m): 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell; essentially unchanged over the last few months. Street sees a value situation with execution risk, not a broken story.\n- Thesis check: We originally bought PFE as a large, diversified pharma trading at a single-digit forward P/E with a covered ~6.5\u20137% yield, where the market is pricing in a steep post-COVID earnings reset. Today\u2019s metrics are almost identical: still ~8x forward earnings, mid-teens margins, double-digit ROE, and a reasonable balance sheet. The modest price dip since 12-16 simply moves the stock slightly below our entry (~$25.77) and deeper into value territory, but not at a dramatically different level. The margin of safety and thesis remain intact. Given our already large position (~35% of NAV), the incremental benefit of adding on this small pullback is not enough to justify even greater concentration.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation: Current price ~$24.07 (slightly below recent ~$24.31), 52w range $21.38\u201329.79. Trailing P/E ~7.84, forward P/E ~10.77, P/B ~1.55, P/S ~1.38, EV/EBITDA ~7.41. Dividend yield ~4.6%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%, ROE ~19.1%, ROA ~4.0%. Debt/equity ~124%, current ratio ~1.01, quick ratio ~0.71. Classic highly-levered but cash-generative telecom profile.\n- Price action (1 month): Drift from mid-$25s earlier in the month to low-$24s now. A controlled pullback from prior optimism, not a panic.\n- Insider activity: Recent transactions are mainly stock awards and related entries for CEO/CFO and other executives, with grant prices around $24.75\u201326.02. Also several stock gifts. No meaningful open-market selling. Overall neutral to mildly positive: insiders are being compensated in stock near current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest recs (0m): 4 strong buy, 12 buy, 9 hold, 0 sell. Slight softening from 13 to 12 buys vs -1m, but the consensus is still broadly constructive.\n- Thesis check: We own T as a low-multiple, cash-flow-heavy telecom with a right-sized dividend, where modest deleveraging and stable wireless/broadband cash flows can deliver attractive income plus potential multiple expansion from an 8x trailing earnings base. All key metrics (P/E, yield, leverage, profitability) are essentially unchanged; today\u2019s price is only modestly below our entry (~$24.84). The main risk remains leverage, not valuation, and there is no evidence of new balance sheet stress from the data available. With T already ~29% of the portfolio, the small additional discount isn\u2019t enough to justify concentrating further into a single highly levered telecom.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price & valuation: Current price ~$499.84, 52w range $440.10\u2013542.07 (upper half of the range, but ~8% below the high). Trailing P/E ~15.97; forward P/E ~20.66 (noisy due to conglomerate accounting); P/S ~2.90. The reported P/B ~0.001 is a known data artifact; in reality Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book. No dividend; value accrues via intrinsic value growth and buybacks.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%, ROE ~10.2%, ROA ~4.8%. Debt/equity ~18.2%, current ratio ~2.72, quick ratio ~2.55. This remains a fortress balance sheet with highly diversified operating businesses and a large cash/marketable securities position.\n- Price action (1 month): Very stable trading in a band from the high-$490s to low-$500s; a mild pullback from earlier highs above $540 earlier in the year. Behavior consistent with a fairly priced, low-volatility compounder.\n- Insider activity: Activity dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s recurring large stock gifts to charities and directors, plus small recurrent gifts by Ajit Jain and others. Ajit Jain sold ~15,000 shares at ~$500 in late September and a smaller sale (2,000 shares) earlier in the year. This pattern is longstanding and not a new negative signal.\n- Street sentiment: Light coverage. Latest snapshot: 0 strong buy, 2 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell; unchanged over the last few months.\n- Thesis check: We own BRK-B as a high-quality, diversified compounding vehicle and portfolio anchor at a fair mid-teens P/E in a market that is broadly fair-to-expensive. Today, it still trades at ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52w range, more \u201cfair value\u201d than \u201cscreaming bargain.\u201d No sign of balance sheet risk or business deterioration; it remains an appropriate quality anchor, but not cheap enough to merit an overweight.\n\n4) New idea search & market context\n- Value screen: The screening tool again returns essentially the same mixed list of very large, widely followed names (BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX) regardless of tighter market-cap parameters, which suggests the tool is not filtering reliably by size.\n- CSWI (a potential underfollowed industrial): Price, ratios, financials, and price history all come back null/empty, and there is no insider or analyst data in this framework. Without basic quantitative data I cannot responsibly form a valuation-based thesis or size a position.\n- Other names from the list: Many (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are quality franchises but generally trade at high-teens to mid-20s P/Es with strong market awareness\u2014more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than \u201cmargin-of-safety deep value.\u201d Verizon (VZ) is a value-ish telecom peer but would simply double down on a leveraged U.S. telecom theme without a clearly superior risk/return to T.\n- Market read from BRK-B and blue chips: With Berkshire at ~16x earnings near the higher end of its valuation band and high-quality staples/consumer names also on rich multiples, the overall U.S. large-cap environment appears fair-to-expensive, not distressed. The best opportunities remain in idiosyncratic value cases like PFE/T rather than the broad index.\n\n5) Overall portfolio assessment\n- PFE and T remain clear value names on single-digit to low-teens forward P/Es with solid, if not bulletproof, balance sheets and meaningful dividend yields (PFE ~6.7%, T ~4.6%). Their underlying businesses and financial profiles are stable in our data set, and our original theses remain intact.\n- BRK-B remains a high-quality core holding at a fair, not cheap, multiple, providing diversification and downside protection.\n- Cash (~10% of NAV) is valuable optionality in a broadly fully valued market and should not be put to work in lower-conviction ideas just to be \u201cfully invested.\u201d\n\nConclusion: No holding is overvalued or fundamentally impaired, and no new name currently offers a clearly superior, well-documented margin of safety. Maintaining the current concentrated, high-conviction three-stock core plus cash is consistent with a patient value-investing approach."

Leverage remains the key risk, but there is no new deterioration evident.\n- 1-month price action:\n  \u2022 Gradual drift from ~25.9 down to ~24.1 with modest bounce to ~24.36; consistent with cooling optimism after a prior rally, not an acute event.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 Recent transactions dominated by stock awards to CEO, CFO, and key officers at ~$24.75\u201326.02, plus some stock gifts.\n  \u2022 No notable open-market insider selling.\n  \u2192 Neutral to mildly positive: management compensation is aligned with today\u2019s price zone.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Latest snapshot (0m): 4 strong buy, 12 buy, 9 hold, 0 sell; only slight softening vs -1m.\n  \u2192 Consensus remains broadly constructive.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 We own T as a low-multiple, cash-flow-heavy telecom with a right-sized dividend and ongoing deleveraging, where investors get paid a mid-single-digit yield while waiting for modest re-rating.\n  \u2022 Current metrics (P/E ~7.9 trailing, ~10.9 forward, yield ~4.6%, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, high but stable leverage) still match this profile; price is modestly below our entry (~$24.84) but not at a dramatically different valuation.\n  \u2192 Thesis holds. Given T is already a large position and the main risk (leverage) is unchanged, the incremental discount is not enough to justify adding more exposure.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price & valuation today:\n  \u2022 Price ~$504.27; 52w range $440.10\u2013$542.07 (upper half, ~7% below high).\n  \u2022 Trailing P/E \u2248 16.1; forward P/E \u2248 20.8 (noisy due to conglomerate accounting).\n  \u2022 P/S \u2248 2.92; reported P/B \u2248 0.001 is a known data artefact\u2014qualitatively Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book.\n  \u2022 No dividend; returns via intrinsic value growth and buybacks.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin \u2248 18.1%; ROE \u2248 10.2%; ROA \u2248 4.8%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity \u2248 18.2%; current ratio \u2248 2.72; quick ratio \u2248 2.55.\n  \u2192 Fortress balance sheet and diversified, high-quality earnings stream.\n- 1-month price action:\n  \u2022 Highly stable trading band from high-$490s to low-$510s, modestly below the 52w high; low volatility, no sign of stress.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 Pattern dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large, recurring stock gifts and small Ajit Jain stock gifts, plus Jain\u2019s occasional sales (e.g., 15,000 shares @ ~$500 in late September, a smaller sale earlier in the year).\n  \u2192 Longstanding behavior; no new signal of concern or enthusiasm.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Latest snapshot: 0 strong buy, 2 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell; light and stable coverage.\n  \u2192 Analysts generally see Berkshire as a high-quality, fairly valued compounder.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 We hold BRK-B as the portfolio\u2019s high-quality, diversified compounding anchor in a market that is broadly fair-to-expensive.\n  \u2022 At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52w range, it still looks like \u201cfair value\u201d rather than a deep value opportunity.\n  \u2192 Appropriate to continue holding as an anchor, but valuation is not compelling enough to add.\n\n5) New ideas / market context\n- Screener run (US, market cap ~$0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u22658) again returned a familiar mix of mostly large, widely followed names: CSWI, BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n  \u2022 Many of these (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are high-quality franchises but typically trade at high-teens to mid-20s P/Es\u2014more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than \u201cmargin of safety\u201d value.\n  \u2022 Verizon (VZ) is a value-ish telecom peer but would simply increase concentration in leveraged U.S. telecom without clearly better risk/return than T.\n  \u2022 MMM and WBA were previously checked; MMM currently looks more fully valued with legal overhangs, and WBA data remain spotty.\n  \u2022 CSWI still lacks usable data in this framework, preventing a responsible valuation-based thesis.\n- Market read via BRK-B and peers:\n  \u2022 Berkshire at ~16x earnings and near the upper half of its 52w range, alongside many blue chips on full valuations, indicates a broadly fair-to-expensive large-cap market.\n  \u2022 Our clearest value plays remain name-specific (PFE, T) rather than broad market exposure.\n\n6) Overall assessment & positioning\n- PFE: Large, diversified pharma at a single-digit forward P/E, ~7% dividend yield, solid profitability, and moderate leverage. Price slightly below entry, fundamentals and sentiment stable. Thesis and margin of safety intact. Hold.\n- T: Low-multiple, cash-generative telecom with elevated but stable leverage and a covered ~4.6% yield. Price modestly below entry, valuation still clearly in value territory. Thesis intact; leverage remains main risk. Hold.\n- BRK-B: High-quality, diversified compounding vehicle at a fair ~16x multiple, providing portfolio ballast and downside protection. Not cheap enough to increase. Hold.\n- Cash (~10%): In a market without obvious new deep-value opportunities and with tools unable to surface attractive, underfollowed small caps with full data, holding cash remains rational. It preserves optionality for future dislocations rather than diluting portfolio quality or forcing low-conviction positions.\n\nConclusion: No holding is overvalued or fundamentally impaired, and no new candidate offers a clearly superior risk/reward with a robust margin of safety. The value-consistent decision today is to make no trades: continue holding PFE, T, and BRK-B, and keep cash uncommitted as dry powder."

No trades since inception.\n\n2) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Valuation today: Price $25.04; 52w range $20.92\u2013$27.69. Trailing P/E \u2248 14.6, forward P/E \u2248 8.3, P/B \u2248 1.53, P/S \u2248 2.27, EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.8. Dividend yield \u2248 6.9%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 15.7%; ROE \u2248 10.6%; ROA \u2248 5.2%; debt/equity \u2248 66.5%; current ratio \u2248 1.28; quick \u2248 0.90. Large, diversified pharma with moderate leverage and solid profitability.\n- Price action (1 month): Mostly between ~$24.4 and ~$26.4, with a spike to ~$26.4 and subsequent pullback to ~$25.0. Volatile but no obvious, tool\u2011visible thesis\u2011breaking event.\n- Insider activity: Recent tape continues to be dominated by option exercises at much higher historical strikes (~$30\u201331) and one small officer sale (~2,500 shares @ ~$25.93). The notable open\u2011market director purchase (19,457 shares @ ~$25.65, \u2248$0.5M) remains an important positive signal near today\u2019s price. No wave of insider selling around current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest snapshot (0m) unchanged: 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell. Analysts still frame this as a value situation with execution risk rather than a broken story.\n- Thesis check: Our thesis is that PFE is a large, diversified pharma trading at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a high, covered dividend, where the post\u2011COVID revenue/earnings reset is already largely priced in. Current metrics (forward P/E ~8.3, ~7% yield, mid\u2011teens margins, ~10% ROE, moderate leverage) match that thesis almost exactly, and the stock sits slightly below our original ~$25.77 entry. Margin of safety remains adequate. Given PFE is already our largest position, the small additional discount vs entry does not justify even greater concentration; we hold, not add.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Valuation today: Price $24.26; 52w range $21.38\u2013$29.79. Trailing P/E \u2248 7.9, forward P/E \u2248 10.9, P/B \u2248 1.56, P/S \u2248 1.39, EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.4. Dividend yield \u2248 4.6%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 17.9%; ROE \u2248 19.1%; ROA \u2248 4.0%; debt/equity \u2248 124%; current ratio \u2248 1.01; quick \u2248 0.71. Classic highly levered but cash\u2011generative telecom; leverage remains the key risk.\n- Price action (1 month): Drifted from mid\u2011$25s to low\u2011$24s and is now ~$24.26\u2014cooling after a prior rally, not a panic.\n- Insider activity: Recent entries are mainly stock awards and related entries for CEO/CFO and other senior executives at ~$24.75\u201326.02 and some stock gifts. No notable open\u2011market selling. This is neutral to mildly positive: management is effectively being paid in stock around current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Current snapshot (0m) still constructive: 4 strong buy, 12 buy, 9 hold, 0 sell\u2014almost unchanged from last month.\n- Thesis check: We own T as a low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom with a right\u2011sized dividend and a deleveraging roadmap, where investors earn a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield while waiting for modest multiple expansion off an ~8x earnings base. Today\u2019s valuation metrics and balance sheet profile are essentially unchanged; price is modestly below our ~$24.84 entry but not dramatically cheaper. The central risk (leverage) is unchanged; valuation is still clearly in value territory. With T already a large position, the incremental discount is not enough to justify adding more exposure to a single highly levered name; we continue to hold.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Valuation today: Price $503.39; 52w range $440.10\u2013$542.07 (upper half, ~7% below high). Trailing P/E \u2248 16.1; forward P/E \u2248 20.8 (noisy due to conglomerate accounting); P/S \u2248 2.92. Reported P/B \u2248 0.001 is a known data artefact; in reality Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 18.1%; ROE \u2248 10.2%; ROA \u2248 4.8%; debt/equity \u2248 18.2%; current ratio \u2248 2.72; quick \u2248 2.55. Fortress balance sheet with diversified, high\u2011quality operating businesses and a large cash/marketable securities pile.\n- Price action (1 month): Very stable band from high\u2011$490s to low\u2011$510s, modestly below 52w high; characteristic of a fairly valued, low\u2011volatility compounder.\n- Insider activity: As usual, dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring stock gifts to charities and directors, plus small gifts and occasional sales by Ajit Jain (e.g., ~15,000 shares @ ~$500 in late September). No insider buying, but this pattern is long\u2011standing and not a new negative signal.\n- Street sentiment: Light and unchanged coverage: 0 strong buy, 2 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell. Analysts broadly see Berkshire as a high\u2011quality, fairly valued compounder.\n- Thesis check: We own BRK-B as the portfolio\u2019s high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor in a market that is broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich. At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52w range, it still looks like fair value, not a deep\u2011value opportunity. It remains appropriate as a core holding; valuation is not compelling enough to increase.\n\n5) New idea scan and market context\n- Screener (US, market cap ~$0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8) again returns mostly very large, widely followed names: CSWI, BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL. Many (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent businesses but trade on high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es\u2014more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than \u201cdeep value with margin of safety.\u201d\n- CSWI check: Fresh calls for CSWI still return null for price, market cap, and all ratios, so we lack even basic quantitative data. Under a disciplined value framework, entering a position without reliable fundamental data is unacceptable, regardless of qualitative appeal.\n- Telecom peer: VZ remains another value\u2011ish U.S. telecom, but adding it would just increase concentration in a single, highly regulated, capital\u2011intensive sector with similar leverage dynamics to T, without clearly better risk/return.\n- Market read via BRK-B and blue chips: Berkshire at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its range, plus consumer\u2011staples and mega\u2011cap tech on rich multiples, suggests the broad U.S. large\u2011cap market is fair\u2011to\u2011expensive, not distressed. Our best opportunities remain idiosyncratic value cases (like PFE and T) rather than broad index\u2011like exposure.\n\n6) Overall positioning and decisions\n- PFE: Still a large, diversified pharma at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a ~7% yield, solid profitability, and moderate leverage. Price slightly below entry, fundamentals and sentiment stable, insider behavior benign to mildly positive. Thesis and margin of safety intact. Action: HOLD.\n- T: Low\u2011P/E, cash\u2011generative telecom with elevated but stable leverage and a covered ~4.6% yield. Price modestly below entry; valuation still clearly in value territory; key risk (leverage) unchanged. Action: HOLD.\n- BRK-B: High\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle at a fair ~16x multiple, serving as our quality anchor and partial market proxy. Not cheap enough to add; no reason to trim. Action: HOLD.\n- Cash (~10%): In the absence of new, well\u2011documented deep\u2011value ideas and given the broadly full valuations in large caps, holding cash as dry powder is rational. It preserves optionality for future dislocations rather than forcing low\u2011conviction trades.\n\nConclusion: No current holding is overvalued or fundamentally impaired, and no new candidate today offers a clearly superior margin of safety. Consistent with a patient, concentrated value strategy, the correct move is to make no trades today."

Dividend yield ~6.8%.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin ~15.7%; ROE ~10.6%; ROA ~5.2%; debt/equity ~66.5%; current ratio ~1.28; quick ~0.90. No sign of new stress.\n- Price action (1y): Volatile but essentially a range between low-$20s (spring selloff) and high-$20s (Oct spike), now consolidating in mid-$20s after a pullback from ~$26.5. Current price is slightly below our entry (~$25.77).\n- Insider activity: Recent tape dominated by large option exercises at much higher historical strikes ($30\u201331) and one small officer sale (~2,500 shares @ ~$25.93). The February 2025 open-market director buy (19,457 shares @ ~$25.65, \u2248$0.5M) remains a strong positive signal right around today\u2019s price.\n- Street sentiment: Stable: 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell. No downgrade wave.\n- Assessment: Our thesis stands: large, diversified pharma trading at a single-digit forward P/E and a high, covered yield, with the post-COVID earnings reset largely priced in. Fundamentals and valuation are almost unchanged vs recent days; price is modestly below entry. Already a ~35% position, so margin-of-safety improvement vs entry is not large enough to justify further concentration.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price: ~$24.15 (52w range $21.38\u2013$29.79).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E ~7.9; forward P/E ~10.8; P/B ~1.55; P/S ~1.39; EV/EBITDA ~7.4. Dividend yield ~4.6%.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%; debt/equity ~124%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71. Leverage remains high but stable.\n- Price action (1y): Strong run from low-$20s to high-$20s, then a pullback and drift in mid-$24s\u2014cooling optimism but no capitulation.\n- Insider activity: Recent transactions are overwhelmingly stock awards and gifts (CEO, CFO, COO, etc.) at ~$24.75\u201326.02. No notable open-market insider selling. Neutral to mildly positive alignment.\n- Street sentiment: Still constructive: 4 strong buy, 12 buy, 9 hold, 0 sell (very similar to prior months).\n- Assessment: Thesis intact: low-multiple, cash-generative telecom with a right-sized dividend and deleveraging path. Valuation remains depressed vs the market; main risk is leverage, not price. With T already roughly 30% of the portfolio, today\u2019s price (slightly below entry) is not a big enough discount to warrant adding more exposure to a single, highly levered telecom.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price: ~$494.53 (52w range $440.10\u2013$542.07).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E ~15.8; forward P/E ~20.4 (noisy); P/S ~2.87; reported P/B is a data artifact but Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book. No dividend.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55. Balance sheet remains a fortress.\n- Price action (1y): Climbed to ATH >$540 in May, then pulled back and has been trading in a relatively tight band just under $500. Current level is in the mid-to-upper portion of the 52-week range.\n- Insider activity: As usual, dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring charitable gifts and small Ajit Jain gifts and sales (most notable: ~15,000 shares sold at ~$500 in Sept). No unusual buying or selling.\n- Street sentiment: Very light but stable coverage: 0 strong buy, 2 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell.\n- Assessment: High-quality, diversified compounding vehicle trading at what looks like fair value (mid-teens P/E) in a broadly fair-to-expensive market. Appropriate as our quality anchor but not a deep-value candidate for additional capital.\n\n4) New idea scan\n- Screener (US, market cap \u2248$0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u22658) again returns mainly large, well-known names (BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, XOM, T, VZ, PFE, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.). These are mostly quality but generally trade at fair-to-rich multiples, not obvious deep-value outliers.\n- CSWI: Still returns null for price and all key ratios; cannot build a quantitative thesis.\n- WBA: Also returns nulls for price/ratios; data gap prevents responsible underwriting.\n- Verizon (VZ):\n  - Price: ~$39.82; 52w range $37.59\u2013$47.36.\n  - Valuation: P/E ~8.49; forward P/E ~8.30; P/B ~1.60; P/S ~1.22; EV/EBITDA ~6.7; dividend yield ~6.9%.\n  - Quality / leverage: Profit margin ~14.4%; ROE ~19.9%; ROA ~5.2%; debt/equity ~165%; current ratio ~0.74; quick ~0.57.\n  - Interpretation: Classic value telecom\u2014similar low multiple and high yield, but with even higher leverage and a slightly weaker liquidity profile than T. Buying it would meaningfully increase concentration in U.S. telecom without delivering clearly superior risk-adjusted returns vs our existing T position.\n\n5) Market context & portfolio stance\n- Berkshire around ~16x earnings in the upper half of its 52-week range, and many high-quality large caps trading at high-teens to mid-20s P/Es, support the view of a fair-to-expensive broad market, not a distressed one.\n- Our portfolio is already concentrated in three names: value + yield in healthcare (PFE), value + yield in telecom (T), and a high-quality conglomerate anchor (BRK-B), plus ~10% cash.\n- No holding is clearly overvalued, and none shows signs of fundamental deterioration. New idea candidates with full data (e.g., VZ) do not offer a clearly superior combination of margin of safety and diversification versus simply holding our current positions and cash.\n\nConclusion: Maintain PFE, T, and BRK-B; make no changes; keep cash as optionality. This respects margin of safety, avoids over-concentration in leveraged telecom, and preserves the ability to act on future dislocations."

            "notes": "Key data and assessment as of 2025\u201112\u201123:\n\n1) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Price & valuation:\n  - Price: ~$25.21 (52w: $20.92\u2013$27.69, upper mid\u2011range, below high).\n  - Trailing P/E: ~14.66; forward P/E: ~8.40.\n  - P/B: ~1.54; P/S: ~2.28; EV/EBITDA: ~7.79.\n  - Dividend yield: ~6.8%.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  - Profit margin: ~15.7%; ROE: ~10.6%; ROA: ~5.2%.\n  - Debt/equity: ~66.5%; current ratio: ~1.28; quick ratio: ~0.90.\n  \u2192 Large, diversified pharma with solid profitability and moderate leverage; no sign of new stress.\n- 1\u2011month price action:\n  - Traded mostly between ~$25.0 and ~$26.4, with a brief spike to ~$26.4 (12\u201115), a sharp high\u2011volume drop on 12\u201116, and then stabilization in the mid\u2011$25s.\n  - Current price is slightly below our ~$25.77 entry and roughly flat vs a month ago.\n- Insider activity (latest dataset):\n  - Numerous large option exercises at much higher strikes (~$30\u201331) by top officers; one modest officer sale (~2,500 shares @ ~$25.93) in March.\n  - A key positive remains the Feb 2025 open\u2011market buy: director Ronald Blaylock purchased ~19,457 shares @ ~$25.65 (~$0.5M) \u2013 very close to today\u2019s price.\n  - No pattern of heavy insider selling at or below current levels.\n- Street sentiment:\n  - Current recommendations: 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell (unchanged vs last month).\n  \u2192 Street still frames this as a value situation with execution risk, not a broken business.\n- Thesis check:\n  - Original thesis: buy a large, diversified pharma on a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a covered ~6\u20137% dividend, where post\u2011COVID earnings normalization is already largely discounted.\n  - Today: forward P/E ~8.4, yield ~6.8%, mid\u2011teens margins, ~10% ROE, moderate leverage \u2013 essentially identical to what we underwrote. Price is modestly below our entry, providing a slightly better margin of safety.\n  - No thesis\u2011breaking news, and insider/Street signals remain broadly supportive.\n  - Position sizing: PFE is already our largest holding (~35% of equity). The modest additional discount vs entry is not sufficiently extreme to justify further concentration.\n  \u2192 Action: HOLD.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation:\n  - Price: ~$24.30 (52w: $21.38\u2013$29.79; well below high, mid\u2011range overall).\n  - Trailing P/E: ~7.92; forward P/E: ~10.89.\n  - P/B: ~1.56; P/S: ~1.40; EV/EBITDA: ~7.45.\n  - Dividend yield: ~4.6%.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  - Profit margin: ~17.9%; ROE: ~19.1%; ROA: ~4.0%.\n  - Debt/equity: ~124%; current ratio: ~1.01; quick ratio: ~0.71.\n  \u2192 Classic highly leveraged but cash\u2011generative telecom; leverage remains the central risk, but liquidity metrics are stable.\n- 1\u2011month price action:\n  - Drifted from high\u2011$25s/low\u2011$26s down into low\u2011$24s, then stabilized around $24.1\u201324.3 recently.\n  - The move looks like cooling optimism after prior strength, not a panic or event\u2011driven collapse.\n- Insider activity:\n  - Recent transactions are overwhelmingly stock awards and small grants to CEO, CFO, COO, and other executives around ~$24.75\u201326.02, plus some stock gifts.\n  - No notable open\u2011market insider selling.\n  \u2192 Neutral to mildly positive: management compensation is aligned with current trading levels.\n- Street sentiment:\n  - Current recommendations: 4 strong buy, 12 buy, 9 hold, 0 sell (very similar to prior months; one fewer \u201cbuy\u201d vs -1m, but still broadly constructive).\n- Thesis check:\n  - Original thesis: own a low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom with a right\u2011sized dividend; investors earn a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield while modest deleveraging and stable cash flows allow for potential multiple expansion from a depressed ~8x earnings base.\n  - Today: trailing P/E ~7.9, forward P/E ~10.9, yield ~4.6%, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, leverage still high but not clearly worsening.\n  - Price is slightly below our ~$24.84 entry, but not at a dramatically different valuation level.\n  - The main risk (leverage) is unchanged; we are already meaningfully exposed (~30% of equity).\n  \u2192 Action: HOLD.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price & valuation:\n  - Price: ~$499.95 (52w: $440.10\u2013$542.07; upper half, ~8% below high).\n  - Trailing P/E: ~15.97; forward P/E: ~20.67 (not very informative given accounting noise).\n  - P/S: ~2.90; reported P/B (~0.001) is a known data artefact; in reality BRK typically trades at a modest premium to book.\n  - No dividend.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  - Profit margin: ~18.1%; ROE: ~10.2%; ROA: ~4.8%.\n  - Debt/equity: ~18.2%; current ratio: ~2.72; quick ratio: ~2.55.\n  \u2192 Fortress balance sheet and highly diversified earnings base (operating businesses + large cash and securities portfolio).\n- 1\u2011month price action:\n  - Very stable: mostly high\u2011$490s to low\u2011$510s, modestly below earlier highs.\n  - Low volatility, typical of a fairly valued compounder.\n- Insider activity:\n  - Dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s recurring large charitable stock gifts (millions of shares) and small gifts by directors; Ajit Jain sold ~15,000 shares @ ~$500 in late September and 2,000 @ ~$465 earlier in the year.\n  - No unusual pattern of insider buying or selling; behavior consistent with long\u2011standing practice.\n- Street sentiment:\n  - Very light coverage: 0 strong buy, 2 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell; stable over recent months.\n  \u2192 Analysts broadly see BRK as a high\u2011quality, fairly valued compounder.\n- Thesis check:\n  - Original thesis: hold BRK\u2011B as a high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor at a fair mid\u2011teens P/E in a broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich market.\n  - Today: trading at ~16x trailing earnings, in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, with no deterioration in quality or balance sheet.\n  - This still looks like \u201cfair value\u201d rather than a deep\u2011value fat pitch.\n  \u2192 Action: HOLD as core anchor; not cheap enough to add, no reason to trim.\n\n4) New idea scan / broader market context\n- Screener run (US, market cap ~$0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8, sector=ALL, limit=50) again returned mostly large, widely followed names: CSWI, BRK\u2011B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n  - Many of these (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are high\u2011quality franchises but typically trade at high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es \u2013 more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than \u201cundervalued with a clear margin of safety.\u201d\n  - Telecom peer VZ has previously screened as value\u2011ish (low P/E, high yield) but carries even higher leverage and similar secular/competitive risks as T; adding it would simply increase concentration in leveraged U.S. telecom without a clearly better risk\u2011reward than our existing T position.\n  - Some tickers like CSWI and WBA continue to have spotty or null data in this tool environment, preventing responsible underwriting.\n- Market read via BRK\u2011B and peers:\n  - BRK\u2011B at ~16x earnings, near the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, suggests the broad U.S. large\u2011cap market is fairly to somewhat richly valued, not in a distressed state.\n  - Many blue\u2011chip names in staples and mega\u2011cap tech also trade at full multiples, reinforcing the idea that broad \u201cbeta\u201d is not cheap.\n\n5) Portfolio\u2011level assessment and positioning\n- Current structure (approximate):\n  - PFE: ~35\u201338% of equity \u2013 value + yield in large\u2011cap pharma.\n  - T: ~30\u201333% of equity \u2013 value + yield in telecom, with leverage as key risk.\n  - BRK\u2011B: ~28\u201330% of equity \u2013 high\u2011quality diversified compounding anchor.\n  - Cash: ~10% \u2013 dry powder.\n- None of the three holdings looks overvalued or fundamentally impaired; all still trade on reasonable to cheap multiples relative to their quality.\n- There is no new candidate, with solid data, that offers a clearly superior combination of undervaluation, quality, and diversification compared with simply maintaining our existing positions and cash.\n- In a value\u2011investing framework emphasizing margin of safety, quality, and patience, it is better to wait for a true dislocation than to chase second\u2011best ideas or add more risk to already concentrated themes (e.g., doubling down further on leveraged telecom).\n\nConclusion: Market conditions and company\u2011specific data do not warrant changes today. The rational value\u2011oriented stance is to HOLD PFE, T, and BRK\u2011B, and keep ~10% cash as optionality for future opportunities."

The slight improvement in entry price versus our initial buy is not dramatic enough to justify additional concentration.\n  \u2192 Decision: HOLD. Thesis and margin of safety remain intact; position already large.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: $24.46 (52w: $21.38\u2013$29.79; mid\u2011range, well below high and slightly below our ~$24.84 entry).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E: 7.97; forward P/E: 10.96.\n  \u2022 P/B: 1.57; P/S: 1.41; EV/EBITDA: 7.47.\n  \u2022 Dividend yield: ~4.5%.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin: ~17.9%; ROE: ~19.1%; ROA: ~4.0%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity: ~124%; current ratio: ~1.01; quick ratio: ~0.71.\n  \u2192 Classic highly leveraged but cash\u2011generative telecom; leverage remains the main structural risk, but liquidity and profitability are stable.\n- 1\u2011month price action:\n  \u2022 Drift from high\u2011$25s/low\u2011$26s to low\u2011$24s, then stabilization around $24\u201324.5. Looks like cooling optimism after prior strength, not an event\u2011driven collapse.\n- Insider activity (latest set):\n  \u2022 Recent transactions mainly stock awards to CEO, CFO, COO and other executives at ~$24.75\u201326.02, plus some stock gifts.\n  \u2022 No meaningful open\u2011market insider selling.\n  \u2192 Neutral to mildly positive: compensation is being granted near current levels; no insider rush for the exits.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Current recs: strong buy 4, buy 12, hold 9, sell 0 (very similar to prior months; still broadly constructive).\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: own a low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom with a right\u2011sized dividend and a focus on deleveraging, where investors earn a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield while waiting for modest multiple expansion off an ~8x earnings base.\n  \u2022 Today\u2019s metrics (P/E ~8x trailing, ~11x forward, yield ~4.5%, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, leverage high but not worsening) still match that profile.\n  \u2022 Price is only slightly below our entry; the valuation gap has not widened enough to transform this into a dramatically better bargain.\n  \u2022 T already represents ~30\u201333% of equity, so incremental capital would meaningfully increase exposure to one highly leveraged telecom.\n  \u2192 Decision: HOLD. Thesis intact; valuation still attractive, but added concentration is not warranted.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: $500.51 (52w: $440.10\u2013$542.07; upper half, ~8% below high; slightly above our ~$497 entry).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E: 16.00; forward P/E: 20.69 (noisy due to conglomerate accounting).\n  \u2022 P/S: 2.90; reported P/B (~0.001) is a data artifact; in reality BRK typically trades at a modest premium to book.\n  \u2022 No dividend.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin: ~18.1%; ROE: ~10.2%; ROA: ~4.8%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity: ~18.2%; current ratio: ~2.72; quick ratio: ~2.55.\n  \u2192 Fortress balance sheet and diversified earnings (operating companies + large cash and marketable securities).\n- 1\u2011month price action:\n  \u2022 Very stable band in the high\u2011$490s to low\u2011$510s, modestly below 52\u2011week highs; low volatility, typical of a fairly valued compounder.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 As usual, dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring stock gifts (millions of shares) and small gifts by directors; Ajit Jain sold ~15,000 shares @ ~$500 in late September and 2,000 @ ~$465 earlier, plus several tiny gifts.\n  \u2022 Pattern consistent with long\u2011standing behavior; no new insider buying or selling that changes the story.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Very light coverage: strong buy 0, buy 2, hold 2, sell 0, unchanged in recent months.\n  \u2192 Analysts broadly see BRK as a high\u2011quality, fairly valued compounder.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: hold BRK\u2011B as a high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor at a fair mid\u2011teens P/E in a market that is broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich.\n  \u2022 At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, Berkshire still looks like fair value rather than a deep\u2011value bargain.\n  \u2192 Decision: HOLD as core anchor. Not cheap enough to add; no reason to trim.\n\n5) New idea work: Verizon (VZ) and screen results\n- Value screen (US, mkt cap ~0.3\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u22658, limit 30) again returns mainly large, widely followed names: CSWI, BRK\u2011B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n  \u2022 Many (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent businesses but typically trade on high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es\u2014more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than \u201cdeep value.\u201d\n  \u2022 Several tickers that previously looked interesting for small/mid\u2011cap value (e.g., CSWI, WBA) still suffer from spotty or null data in this tool environment, which prevents responsible under\u00adwriting.\n- Verizon (VZ) check (today):\n  \u2022 Price: $39.92 (52w: $37.59\u2013$47.36).\n  \u2022 Valuation: P/E 8.51; forward P/E 8.32; P/B 1.60; P/S 1.22; EV/EBITDA 6.72; dividend yield ~6.9%.\n  \u2022 Quality / leverage: profit margin ~14.4%; ROE ~19.9%; ROA ~5.2%; debt/equity ~165%; current ratio ~0.74; quick ratio ~0.57.\n  \u2192 VZ is a classic value telecom: low P/E, high yield, but even higher leverage and weaker liquidity than T. Adding it would simply increase concentration in heavily levered U.S. telecom without clearly superior risk\u2011adjusted return versus our existing T holding.\n  \u2192 Net: VZ is interesting but not clearly better than T; combining both would stack similar balance\u2011sheet and regulatory risks.\n\n6) Market context via BRK\u2011B and peers\n- BRK\u2011B at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, along with many blue\u2011chip staples and mega\u2011cap tech on high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es, suggests a broad U.S. large\u2011cap market that is fair\u2011to\u2011expensive, not distressed.\n- Our current edge remains in name\u2011specific value cases (PFE, T) plus a high\u2011quality anchor (BRK\u2011B), rather than broad market exposure.\n- With ~10\u201312% cash, we retain optionality to act if a genuine dislocation appears, especially in smaller, less\u2011followed names once reliable data are available.\n\n7) Overall positioning\n- PFE: Large, diversified pharma on ~8.3x forward earnings with a ~6.9% yield, solid profitability, and moderate leverage. Price slightly below entry; thesis and margin of safety intact. HOLD.\n- T: Low\u2011P/E, cash\u2011generative telecom with elevated but stable leverage and a covered ~4.5% yield. Price slightly below entry; central risk (leverage) unchanged. HOLD.\n- BRK\u2011B: High\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle at a fair ~16x multiple, serving as portfolio ballast. Fairly valued, not cheap; HOLD.\n- Cash (~10\u201312%): In a broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich market with no clearly superior new idea, holding cash as dry powder remains consistent with a disciplined margin\u2011of\u2011safety value strategy.\n\nConclusion: No existing holding is overvalued or impaired, and no new candidate today offers a clearly better risk/reward or diversification profile than our current mix plus cash. The rational value\u2011investing decision is to make no trades today."

TTM P/E 14.6; forward P/E 8.34; P/B 1.53; P/S 2.27; EV/EBITDA 7.75; dividend yield ~6.9%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~15.7%; ROE ~10.6%; ROA ~5.2%; debt/equity ~66.5%; current ratio ~1.28; quick ~0.90. Solid, moderately levered large\u2011cap pharma.\n- Price action (1 mo): Mostly mid\u2011$25s with a spike to ~26.4 then a high\u2011volume drop and consolidation around $25. Range\u2011bound rather than trending.\n- Insider / Street: Recent tape dominated by option exercises and one small officer sale; key positive remains Feb 2025 director open\u2011market buy of ~19,457 shares at ~$25.65 (~$0.5M), near today\u2019s price. Analyst snapshot unchanged: 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell.\n- Thesis check: We own PFE as a large, diversified pharma on a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a high, covered yield, where post\u2011COVID normalization is largely priced in. Today\u2019s metrics are essentially identical to what we underwrote, and the stock is modestly below our ~$25.77 entry. Business quality and balance sheet are intact; no evidence of deterioration. However, PFE is already our largest position (~35%+ of equity), and the price is not dramatically cheaper than our entry. Margin of safety remains acceptable, but not sufficiently improved to justify additional concentration.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation: $24.66 (52w $21.38\u201329.79). TTM P/E 8.03; forward P/E 11.05; P/B 1.58; P/S 1.42; EV/EBITDA 7.50; dividend yield ~4.5%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%; debt/equity ~124%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71. Classic highly leveraged but cash\u2011generative telecom; leverage is the main structural risk.\n- Price action (1 mo): Drift from high\u2011$25s/low\u2011$26s into low\u2011$24s, now at $24.66 slightly below our ~$24.84 entry. Controlled pullback, no panic.\n- Insider / Street: Recent activity is almost entirely stock awards and stock gifts to the CEO/CFO/other execs around $24.75\u201326.02; no notable open\u2011market selling. Analyst stance remains very constructive: 4 strong buy, 12 buy, 9 hold, 0 sell, nearly unchanged month\u2011over\u2011month.\n- Thesis check: We own T as a low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom with a right\u2011sized dividend, where investors collect a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield while modest deleveraging and steady cash flows can support some multiple normalization from ~8x earnings. Today\u2019s numbers still match that profile; the central risk (high leverage) is unchanged, and valuation is still clearly in value territory. Price is only slightly below our entry, and T already represents roughly 30%+ of equity, so the incremental margin of safety is not big enough to justify adding more to a single highly levered telecom.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price & valuation: $501.34 (52w $440.10\u2013542.07; upper half of range, ~8% below high). TTM P/E 16.0; forward P/E ~20.7 (noisy); P/S 2.91; reported P/B ~0.001 is a data artefact\u2014qualitatively, BRK usually trades at a modest premium to book. No dividend.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55. Fortress balance sheet with highly diversified operating businesses and a large cash/securities portfolio.\n- Price action (1 mo): Very tight band high\u2011$490s to low\u2011$510s, low volatility, characteristic of a fairly valued compounder consolidating below its highs.\n- Insider / Street: Insider tape dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring charitable stock gifts and small gifts/sales by Ajit Jain (notably ~15k shares sold around $500 in September); longstanding pattern, no new signal. Analyst coverage remains light and stable: 0 strong buy, 2 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell.\n- Thesis check: We hold BRK\u2011B as our high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor in a market that is broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich. At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, Berkshire still looks like \u201cfair value\u201d rather than a deep\u2011value opportunity. No reason to trim given quality and balance sheet strength, but not cheap enough to warrant adding.\n\n5) New ideas and market context\n- Screener (US, mkt cap ~$0.3\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8, sector=ALL, limit=30) again returns mostly large, widely followed names (BRK\u2011B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, XOM, T, VZ, PFE, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.). These are generally strong franchises but usually trade at high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es\u2014more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than \u201cdeep value.\u201d\n- INTC check: Price $36.16; but TTM P/E ~603 and forward P/E ~60.7, with profit margin ~0.4% and ROE ~0.2%. Earnings are extremely depressed and the headline low P/B (~1.6) masks a huge valuation on actual current profits. That does not offer a clear margin of safety today.\n- WBA and CSWI: Tools still return null/empty data for key fields (price, ratios, history), so we lack the basic quantitative foundation needed for a disciplined intrinsic\u2011value assessment.\n- Market read via BRK\u2011B and peers: With Berkshire at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its range, and many blue\u2011chip staples and mega\u2011cap tech names on rich multiples, the broad U.S. large\u2011cap market still appears fair\u2011to\u2011expensive rather than distressed. Our clearest value remains stock\u2011specific (PFE, T) rather than in broad beta.\n\n6) Overall assessment and positioning\n- PFE: Still a large, diversified pharma on ~8.3x forward earnings with a ~6.9% dividend, solid profitability, and moderate leverage. Price slightly below our entry, fundamentals and sentiment stable, insider behavior benign-to-positive. Thesis and margin of safety intact. Position already large. \u2192 HOLD.\n- T: Low\u2011P/E, cash\u2011generative telecom with elevated but stable leverage and a covered ~4.5% yield. Price marginally below entry; valuation remains clearly in value territory, but leverage risk is unchanged, and exposure is already meaningful. \u2192 HOLD.\n- BRK\u2011B: High\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle at a fair ~16x multiple, providing portfolio ballast and downside protection. Not cheap enough to add, and no deterioration to justify trimming. \u2192 HOLD.\n- Cash (~10\u201311%): In a broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich market, with no new high\u2011conviction, data\u2011supported deep\u2011value idea that improves the portfolio\u2019s risk/reward or diversification, holding cash as dry powder is consistent with a patient, margin\u2011of\u2011safety value strategy.\n\nConclusion: No existing holding is overvalued or impaired, and no new candidate today offers a superior margin of safety or diversification benefit. The disciplined value choice is to make no trades and remain patient."

Recent closes ($24.88\u201325.03) are modestly below our entry but not a major dislocation.\n- Insider activity (latest filings):\n  \u2022 Numerous large option exercises at much higher historical strike prices (~$30\u201331) by senior executives (CEO Bourla and others) \u2013 normal comp, not a fresh signal.\n  \u2022 One modest officer open\u2011market sale (~2,500 shares @ $25.93) in March.\n  \u2022 Positive anchor: Feb 2025 open\u2011market director purchase (Blaylock) of ~19,457 shares @ ~$25.65 (~$0.5M), right around today\u2019s price.\n  \u2192 No pattern of heavy insider selling at or below current levels; one substantial insider buy remains a supportive signal.\n- Street sentiment: latest recommendation snapshot is unchanged vs prior months: 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell. No downgrade wave; Street still frames this as a value/normalization story with execution risk.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: large, diversified pharma at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a high, covered ~6\u20137% yield, where post\u2011COVID earnings normalization is largely priced in.\n  \u2022 Today\u2019s metrics (fwd P/E ~8.3, yield ~6.9%, mid\u2011teens margins, ~10% ROE, moderate leverage, stable liquidity) are essentially identical to what we underwrote.\n  \u2022 Price is slightly below entry, increasing margin of safety a bit, but PFE is already our largest position (~38% of equity).\n  \u2192 No thesis change; margin of safety remains adequate. The small additional discount is not large enough to justify further concentration. Decision: HOLD.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Current snapshot:\n  \u2022 Price: $24.66; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79 (mid\u2011range, well below high; slightly below our ~$24.84 entry).\n  \u2022 Valuation: TTM P/E 8.03; forward P/E 11.05; P/B 1.58; P/S 1.42; EV/EBITDA 7.50; dividend yield ~4.5%.\n  \u2022 Quality / balance sheet: profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%; debt/equity ~124%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71.\n- Price action (last month): Drift from high\u2011$25s/low\u2011$26s into low\u2011$24s, then a mild bounce to $24.66. This is a controlled pullback from prior optimism, not an event\u2011driven collapse.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 Recent transactions are overwhelmingly stock awards/grants to CEO/CFO/COO and key officers at ~$24.75\u201326.02, plus some stock gifts; a variety of deferred/indirect ownership entries.\n  \u2022 No notable open\u2011market insider selling.\n  \u2192 Neutral to mildly positive: compensation is being granted around current levels; management is not exiting stock.\n- Street sentiment: latest snapshot: 4 strong buy, 12 buy, 9 hold, 0 sell. Very similar to one and two months ago; the analyst community remains broadly constructive.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: own a low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom with a right\u2011sized dividend; investors collect a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield while modest deleveraging and steady wireless/broadband cash flows allow for potential multiple normalization from ~8x earnings.\n  \u2022 Today\u2019s profile is unchanged: trailing P/E ~8x, forward P/E ~11x, yield ~4.5%, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, with leverage still high but not obviously worsening.\n  \u2022 Price is marginally below our entry but not dramatically cheaper; T is already roughly 33% of equity.\n  \u2192 Thesis intact; main risk remains structural leverage rather than valuation. The small incremental discount does not justify further concentration in a single highly leveraged telecom. Decision: HOLD.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Current snapshot:\n  \u2022 Price: $501.34; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (upper half; ~8% below high; slightly above our ~$497 entry).\n  \u2022 Valuation: TTM P/E 16.03; forward P/E 20.72 (noisy due to conglomerate accounting); P/S 2.91; reported P/B ~0.001 is a data artifact \u2013 in reality BRK usually trades at a modest premium to book. No dividend.\n  \u2022 Quality / balance sheet: profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55.\n- Price action (last month): Very tight trading band high\u2011$490s to low\u2011$510s, with low volatility, consolidating below prior highs >$540.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 As usual, activity is dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring stock gifts (millions of shares to charities) and small gifts by directors; Ajit Jain sold ~15,000 shares at ~$500 in late September and 2,000 at ~$465 earlier, plus a few tiny gifts.\n  \u2022 No unusual insider buying or selling in recent weeks.\n- Street sentiment: very light and stable coverage \u2013 0 strong buy, 2 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: hold BRK\u2011B as a high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor at a fair mid\u2011teens P/E in a market that is broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich.\n  \u2022 At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, BRK\u2011B still looks like \u201cfair value,\u201d not a deep\u2011value bargain or obvious sell.\n  \u2022 There is no evidence of balance sheet or franchise deterioration.\n  \u2192 Appropriate to keep as our quality anchor and implicit market proxy; not cheap enough to overweight, no reason to trim. Decision: HOLD.\n\n4) New idea scan and broader market conditions\n- Screener (US, mkt cap ~$0.3\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8, sector=ALL, limit=30) again returns mostly very large, widely followed names: CSWI, BRK\u2011B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n  \u2022 Many (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent franchises but typically trade at high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es \u2013 more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than \u201cundervalued with a wide margin of safety.\u201d\n  \u2022 INTC: currently ~$36 with a very high P/E (TTM ~600x, forward ~60x) due to depressed earnings; headline low P/B masks an enormous multiple of current profits, which is not a classic value setup.\n  \u2022 VZ: low P/E and high yield, but carries even higher leverage (debt/equity ~165%) and weaker liquidity than T; owning it alongside T would simply concentrate us further in U.S. telecom with similar risks and no clearly superior risk\u2011reward vs T.\n  \u2022 CSWI and WBA: still have spotty/null data for key fields (price/ratios/history) in this environment, so I cannot responsibly build an intrinsic\u2011value thesis.\n- Market read via BRK\u2011B and peers:\n  \u2022 BRK\u2011B trading at ~16x earnings near the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, plus many blue\u2011chip staples and mega\u2011cap tech on rich multiples, suggests the broad U.S. large\u2011cap market remains fair\u2011to\u2011expensive, not distressed.\n  \u2022 Our edge thus remains in specific value names (like PFE, T) plus a high\u2011quality anchor (BRK\u2011B), not in broad index\u2011like exposure at current levels.\n\n5) Portfolio\u2011level assessment\n- Approximate structure:\n  \u2022 PFE: ~38% of equity \u2013 value + high yield in large\u2011cap pharma.\n  \u2022 T: ~33% of equity \u2013 value + yield in telecom, with leverage risk.\n  \u2022 BRK\u2011B: ~28% of equity \u2013 high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor.\n  \u2022 Cash: ~11% \u2013 dry powder.\n- None of the three holdings is:\n  \u2022 Overvalued on fundamentals, or\n  \u2022 Showing tool\u2011visible signs of structural deterioration.\n- The screener and follow\u2011up checks do not surface a new, under\u2011followed small/mid\u2011cap with better risk/reward or diversification benefits than our current mix.\n- Within a value\u2011investing framework (margin of safety, concentration, and patience), it is preferable to hold cash and wait for a genuine dislocation rather than dilute the portfolio with lower\u2011conviction ideas or double\u2011up on similar risks (e.g., adding another highly levered telecom).\n\nConclusion: All three holdings remain aligned with their original theses and still offer reasonable to attractive value; no new, clearly superior idea appears today. Best course: HOLD PFE, T, and BRK\u2011B, and keep cash uncommitted as optionality."

The small discount vs entry improves margin of safety slightly but not enough to justify additional concentration.\n  - Decision: HOLD.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation:\n  - Price: $24.65; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79 (mid-range, well below high; slightly below our ~$24.84 entry).\n  - TTM P/E: 8.03; forward P/E: 11.05.\n  - P/B: 1.58; P/S: 1.42; EV/EBITDA: ~7.50.\n  - Dividend yield: ~4.5%.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  - Profit margin: ~17.9%; ROE: ~19.1%; ROA: ~4.0%.\n  - Debt/equity: ~124%; current ratio: ~1.01; quick ratio: ~0.71.\n  \u2192 Classic highly leveraged but cash-generative telecom; leverage remains the key structural risk, but liquidity and profitability metrics look stable.\n- 1-month price action:\n  - Drifted from high-$25s/low-$26s into low-$24s, then modest bounce and stabilization around $24.6.\n  - Price behavior reflects cooling optimism after earlier strength, not an acute negative event.\n- Interpretation vs thesis:\n  - We own T as a low-multiple, cash-flow-heavy telecom with a right-sized dividend, where investors collect a mid-single-digit yield while modest deleveraging and stable cash flows allow some multiple normalization from a depressed earnings base.\n  - Today\u2019s numbers (P/E ~8x trailing, ~11x forward, ~4.5% yield, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, high but steady leverage) continue to fit that thesis.\n  - Shares are a bit below our entry but not dramatically cheaper; T already represents roughly one-third of equity. The incremental valuation edge is not sufficient to justify adding more exposure to a single highly levered telecom.\n  - Decision: HOLD.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price & valuation:\n  - Price: $498.30; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (upper half, ~8% below high; slightly above our ~$497 entry).\n  - TTM P/E: 15.93; forward P/E: 20.60 (noisy due to conglomerate accounting).\n  - P/S: 2.89; reported P/B is a known data quirk, but qualitatively Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book.\n  - No dividend; returns via intrinsic value growth and buybacks.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  - Profit margin: ~18.1%; ROE: ~10.2%; ROA: ~4.8%.\n  - Debt/equity: ~18.2%; current ratio: ~2.72; quick ratio: ~2.55.\n  \u2192 Fortress balance sheet and diversified, high-quality earnings stream.\n- 1-month price action:\n  - Very tight trading band from high-$490s to low-$510s, modestly below the 52-week high; low volatility, typical of a fairly valued compounder.\n- Interpretation vs thesis:\n  - We hold BRK-B as a high-quality, diversified compounding anchor in a market that is broadly fair-to-rich.\n  - At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52-week range, Berkshire still looks like fair value, not a deep-value opportunity or a sell.\n  - There is no sign of balance sheet or business deterioration.\n  - Decision: HOLD as core anchor; not cheap enough to add, no reason to trim.\n\n4) New idea scan and broader market conditions\n- Screener (US, market cap ~$0.3\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8, sector=ALL, limit=30) again returns mostly large, widely followed names: BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n  - Many (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent businesses but typically trade at high-teens to mid-20s P/Es, i.e., quality at a full price rather than clear deep value with wide margin of safety.\n- CSWI:\n  - Fresh calls for price and ratios still return null for all key fields (price, market cap, P/E, etc.). Without basic financial and valuation data, a disciplined intrinsic-value thesis is not possible.\n- Verizon (VZ) as a peer check:\n  - Price: $40.48; 52w range: $37.59\u2013$47.36.\n  - Valuation: P/E 8.63; forward P/E 8.43; P/B 1.62; P/S 1.24; EV/EBITDA 6.76; dividend yield ~6.8%.\n  - Quality/leverage: profit margin ~14.4%; ROE ~19.9%; ROA ~5.2%; debt/equity ~165%; current ratio ~0.74; quick ratio ~0.57.\n  \u2192 VZ is a classic value telecom with an attractive yield and low P/E, but leverage is even higher and liquidity weaker than T. Risk profile is very similar to T, not clearly better. Owning both would increase concentration in U.S. telecom without obvious improvement in risk-adjusted return.\n- Market context via BRK-B and peers:\n  - BRK-B at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its 52-week range, plus many blue-chip staples and mega-cap tech on rich multiples, supports the view that the broad U.S. large-cap market is fair-to-expensive, not distressed.\n  - Our edge remains in specific idiosyncratic value names (PFE, T) plus a quality anchor (BRK-B), rather than broad beta at current prices.\n\n5) Portfolio-level view and positioning\n- Approximate structure at today\u2019s prices:\n  - PFE: ~38% of equity \u2013 value + high yield in large-cap pharma.\n  - T: ~33% of equity \u2013 value + yield in telecom, with leverage risk.\n  - BRK-B: ~28% of equity \u2013 high-quality diversified compounding anchor.\n  - Cash: ~11% \u2013 dry powder.\n- None of the three holdings appears overvalued on fundamentals or impaired; all still trade at reasonable to attractive multiples given their quality and risk.\n- The value screen and follow-up checks do not surface a new, clearly superior small/mid-cap opportunity with robust data and a better margin of safety/diversification profile than our existing mix.\n- Within a margin-of-safety, long-term value framework, the rational stance is to avoid forced activity, maintain current positions, and preserve cash for a true dislocation rather than dilute portfolio quality with lower-conviction names or stacking more of the same telecom risk.\n\nOverall conclusion for today: HOLD PFE, T, and BRK-B; retain cash as optionality. No trades."

No pattern of heavy insider selling at or below current prices.\n  \u2022 Analyst recommendations remain stable: latest snapshot (0m) = 3 Strong Buy, 7 Buy, 15 Hold, 1 Sell; identical to prior month.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: own a large, diversified pharma at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a high, covered ~6\u20137% yield, where the post\u2011COVID earnings reset and pipeline risk are largely reflected in the price.\n  \u2022 Today\u2019s metrics (forward P/E ~8.3, ~6.9% yield, mid\u2011teens margins, ~10% ROE, moderate leverage) line up almost exactly with that thesis; there is no tool\u2011visible sign of business or balance\u2011sheet deterioration.\n  \u2022 The stock is modestly below our entry, improving margin of safety slightly, but PFE is already our largest position (~high\u201130s % of equity).\n  \u2022 From a value + risk perspective, the incremental upside from adding a bit cheaper is not large enough to justify greater concentration.\n  \u2192 Decision on PFE: HOLD. Thesis intact, valuation still attractive, but position sizing is already substantial.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: ~$24.77; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79 (mid\u2011range, well below the high; slightly below our ~$24.84 entry).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E: ~8.07; forward P/E: ~11.10.\n  \u2022 P/B: ~1.59; P/S: ~1.42; EV/EBITDA: ~7.52.\n  \u2022 Dividend yield: ~4.5%.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin: ~17.9%; ROE: ~19.1%; ROA: ~4.0%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity: ~124%; current ratio: ~1.01; quick ratio: ~0.71.\n  \u2192 Classic highly leveraged but cash\u2011generative telecom; leverage remains the key structural risk, but profitability and liquidity look stable.\n- 1\u2011month price action:\n  \u2022 Drifted from high\u2011$25s/low\u2011$26s down into low\u2011$24s, then a modest bounce and stabilization around ~$24.7.\n  \u2022 This is consistent with cooling optimism after prior strength, not an event\u2011driven collapse.\n- Insider & Street signals:\n  \u2022 Insider tape shows recent stock awards/grants (CEO, CFO, COO and other officers) around $24.75\u201326.02 and some stock gifts; no notable open\u2011market selling.\n  \u2022 Latest recommendations: 4 Strong Buy, 12 Buy, 9 Hold, 0 Sell (very similar to the last few months, with only a tiny change in the mix). Analyst stance remains broadly constructive.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: own a low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom with a right\u2011sized dividend and a deleveraging roadmap; collect a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield while modest deleveraging and stable wireless/broadband cash flows allow for some multiple normalization off an ~8x earnings base.\n  \u2022 Today\u2019s profile \u2014 P/E ~8x trailing, ~11x forward, ~4.5% yield, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, leverage still high but not worsening \u2014 is almost unchanged.\n  \u2022 The stock is slightly below our entry, but not at a meaningfully different valuation level.\n  \u2022 T already accounts for roughly one\u2011third of portfolio equity; adding would significantly increase exposure to a single, highly levered telecom without a dramatically improved margin of safety.\n  \u2192 Decision on T: HOLD. Thesis intact; valuation remains clearly in value territory, but concentration and leverage risk argue against adding.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: ~$501.05; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (upper half; ~8% below high; slightly above our ~$497 entry).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E: ~16.02; forward P/E: ~20.7 (noisy due to investment mark\u2011to\u2011market and conglomerate accounting).\n  \u2022 P/S: ~2.90; reported P/B (~0.001) is a data artifact \u2014 in reality Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book.\n  \u2022 No dividend; value accrues via intrinsic value growth and buybacks.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin: ~18.1%; ROE: ~10.2%; ROA: ~4.8%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity: ~18.2%; current ratio: ~2.72; quick ratio: ~2.55.\n  \u2192 Fortress balance sheet, diversified operating businesses and large cash/securities portfolio.\n- 1\u2011month price action:\n  \u2022 Very stable band high\u2011$490s to low\u2011$510s, modestly below the 52w high; low volatility consistent with a fairly valued compounder.\n- Insider & Street signals:\n  \u2022 Recent activity: Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring stock gifts to charities (multi\u2011million\u2011share gifts), smaller gifts by directors, and Ajit Jain\u2019s earlier sale (~15,000 shares at ~$500 in Sept plus a smaller sale at ~$465) and tiny gifts. This pattern is long\u2011standing and not new.\n  \u2022 Analyst recommendations remain light and steady: 0 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 2 Hold, 0 Sell.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: hold BRK\u2011B as a high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor in a market that is broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich; accept a fair mid\u2011teens P/E in exchange for quality, diversification, and balance\u2011sheet strength.\n  \u2022 At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52w range, BRK\u2011B still looks like \"fair value\" rather than a deep\u2011value bargain, and certainly not expensive enough to sell.\n  \u2022 No evidence of deterioration in quality or balance sheet.\n  \u2192 Decision on BRK\u2011B: HOLD as core anchor; not cheap enough to increase, and no reason to trim.\n\n5) New idea scan and candidates\n- Screener (min market cap $0.5B, max $20B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u22658, sector=ALL, limit=30) again returns primarily large, widely followed names: CSWI, BRK\u2011B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n  \u2022 Many (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are high\u2011quality franchises but typically trade on high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es \u2014 more \"quality at a full price\" than \"discount with margin of safety\" at the business level.\n- Verizon (VZ) spot\u2011check today:\n  \u2022 Price: ~$40.48; 52w $37.59\u2013$47.36.\n  \u2022 Valuation: P/E ~8.63; forward P/E ~8.43; P/B ~1.62; P/S ~1.24; EV/EBITDA ~6.76; dividend yield ~6.8%.\n  \u2022 Quality/leverage: profit margin ~14.4%; ROE ~19.9%; ROA ~5.2%; debt/equity ~165%; current ratio ~0.74; quick ~0.57.\n  \u2192 VZ is a classic value telecom (low P/E, high yield) but with even higher leverage and weaker liquidity than T. Risk profile is extremely similar; adding it would stack more U.S. telecom leverage without clearly superior risk\u2011adjusted return versus T.\n- CSWI check today:\n  \u2022 Tools still return null for price, market cap, and all key ratios.\n  \u2192 Without basic quantitative data, a disciplined intrinsic\u2011value thesis isn\u2019t possible; I will not buy what I cannot quantitatively evaluate.\n- Overall market context (using BRK\u2011B and peers as a proxy):\n  \u2022 BRK\u2011B at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its 52w range, alongside staples and mega\u2011cap tech names on rich multiples, suggests the broad U.S. large\u2011cap market is fair\u2011to\u2011expensive, not distressed.\n  \u2022 Our clearest value remains in specific, idiosyncratic names (PFE, T) and in holding a high\u2011quality anchor (BRK\u2011B) rather than buying broad beta or stretching into lower\u2011conviction ideas.\n\n6) Portfolio\u2011level conclusion\n- Current approximate mix:\n  \u2022 PFE: ~38% of equity \u2014 value + high yield in large\u2011cap pharma.\n  \u2022 T: ~33% of equity \u2014 value + yield in telecom, with leverage risk.\n  \u2022 BRK\u2011B: ~28% of equity \u2014 high\u2011quality diversified compounding anchor.\n  \u2022 Cash: ~10\u201311% \u2014 dry powder.\n- None of the three holdings is:\n  \u2022 Overvalued on a fundamental basis, or\n  \u2022 Showing signs of structural deterioration in the available data.\n- The screener and follow\u2011up checks do not surface a new candidate with a clearly superior margin of safety and diversification benefit versus simply holding our current positions plus cash.\n- In a margin\u2011of\u2011safety, concentrated value framework, it is better to remain patient and keep cash as optionality than to force activity or double up further on similar risks (e.g., adding VZ alongside T).\n\nNet: No thesis changes and no compelling new idea today; the best risk\u2011adjusted move is to hold existing positions and maintain cash."

TTM P/E 14.53; forward P/E 8.34; P/B 1.53; P/S 2.26; EV/EBITDA 7.74; dividend yield ~6.9%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~15.7%; ROE ~10.6%; ROA ~5.2%; debt/equity ~66.5%; current ratio ~1.28; quick ~0.90. This is still a solid, moderately levered large\u2011cap pharma profile.\n- 1\u2011month price action: Mostly range\u2011bound between ~$25 and ~$26.4. There was a spike to ~$26.4 mid\u2011month, a high\u2011volume drop on 12\u201116, then consolidation around $25. Today\u2019s price is slightly below our entry but near the recent consolidation zone.\n- Insider activity: Recent filings are dominated by large option exercises at much higher historical strikes (~$30\u201331) by senior executives and a single modest officer sale (~2,500 shares at ~$25.93). Importantly, the Feb 2025 open\u2011market director purchase of 19,457 shares at ~$25.65 (~$0.5M) is right around today\u2019s price and remains a strong positive alignment signal. No pattern of heavy insider selling at or below current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest recommendations (0m): 3 Strong Buy, 7 Buy, 15 Hold, 1 Sell \u2013 unchanged vs last month. Analysts still frame PFE as a value/normalization story with execution risk, not a broken business.\n- Thesis check: We own PFE as a large, diversified pharma on a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a high, covered yield, where the post\u2011COVID earnings reset and pipeline risk are largely priced in. Today\u2019s metrics (forward P/E ~8.3, ~6.9% yield, mid\u2011teens margins, ~10% ROE, moderate leverage) are essentially identical to what we underwrote, with the stock now a few percent below our entry. The margin of safety remains adequate. However, PFE is already our largest position (high\u201130s % of equity); the small discount vs entry is not large enough to justify further concentration. \u2192 Action: HOLD.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation (today): Price $24.81; 52w range $21.38\u2013$29.79 (mid\u2011range, well below high, slightly below our ~$24.84 entry). TTM P/E 8.08; forward P/E 11.12; P/B 1.59; P/S 1.43; EV/EBITDA 7.53; dividend yield ~4.5%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%; debt/equity ~124%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71. This remains a classic highly leveraged but cash\u2011generative telecom; leverage is the key structural risk, but profitability and liquidity metrics are stable.\n- 1\u2011month price action: Drift from high\u2011$25s/low\u2011$26s into low\u2011$24s, followed by a modest bounce and stabilization around ~$24.7\u201324.8. This is consistent with cooling optimism after earlier strength, not an event\u2011driven collapse.\n- Insider activity: Recent transactions are overwhelmingly stock awards and related entries (CEO, CFO, COO, other officers) around $24.75\u201326.02, plus several stock gifts. There is no meaningful open\u2011market insider selling. That is neutral to mildly positive \u2013 management is being compensated in stock around current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest snapshot (0m): 4 Strong Buy, 12 Buy, 9 Hold, 0 Sell (very similar to prior months; only a tiny shift in the mix). The analyst community remains broadly constructive.\n- Thesis check: We own T as a low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom with a right\u2011sized dividend, where investors collect a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield while modest deleveraging and stable wireless/broadband cash flows allow for some multiple normalization off an ~8x earnings base. Today\u2019s profile \u2013 P/E ~8x trailing, ~11x forward, ~4.5% yield, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, high but steady leverage \u2013 remains intact. Price is only slightly below our entry; valuation has not reset to a dramatically better bargain. T already represents roughly one\u2011third of equity; adding would significantly increase exposure to a single highly levered telecom without a meaningfully improved margin of safety. \u2192 Action: HOLD.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price & valuation (today): Price $503.71; 52w range $440.10\u2013$542.07 (upper half, ~7% below high; slightly above our ~$497 entry). TTM P/E 16.10; forward P/E 20.82 (noisy, given conglomerate accounting); P/S 2.92; reported P/B ~0.001 is a data artefact \u2013 in reality Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book. No dividend.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ratio ~2.55. This is still a fortress balance sheet with diversified, high\u2011quality earnings (operating businesses plus a large cash/marketable\u2011securities portfolio).\n- 1\u2011month price action: Very tight band from high\u2011$490s to low\u2011$510s, modestly below the 52\u2011week high; low volatility typical of a fairly valued compounder consolidating.\n- Insider activity: As usual, dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring charitable stock gifts (multi\u2011million\u2011share transfers at $0 in filings) and small gifts by directors; Ajit Jain sold ~15,000 shares at ~$500 in late September plus a smaller sale at ~$465 earlier. No unusual pattern of insider buying or selling in recent weeks \u2013 behavior is consistent with long\u2011standing practice.\n- Street sentiment: Very light, stable coverage: 0 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 2 Hold, 0 Sell.\n- Thesis check: We hold BRK-B as our high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor in a market that is broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich. At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, Berkshire still looks like \u201cfair value\u201d rather than a deep\u2011value bargain, and certainly not expensive enough to sell. There is no evidence of balance\u2011sheet or business deterioration. \u2192 Action: HOLD as core anchor; not cheap enough to add, no reason to trim.\n\n5) New idea scan & market conditions\n- Screener today (US, min market cap $0.3B, max $5B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8, sector=ALL, limit=30) again returned mostly large, widely followed names: CSWI, BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL. Many of these (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent franchises but typically on high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es \u2013 more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than clear deep value.\n- CSWI and WBA: As on prior days, tools still do not return clean key fields (price/ratios/history) for CSWI or WBA, so we lack the basic quantitative foundation needed for a disciplined intrinsic\u2011value thesis.\n- Verizon (VZ) as a telecom peer check (from prior and recent data): Price ~low $40s, 52w range $37.59\u201347.36; P/E ~8.6; forward P/E ~8.4; P/B ~1.6; P/S ~1.2; EV/EBITDA ~6.7; dividend yield ~6.8%. Profit margin ~14.4%; ROE ~19.9%; ROA ~5.2%; but debt/equity ~165% and liquidity weaker than T. In short, VZ is another classic value telecom with low P/E and high yield but even higher leverage. Adding it would simply increase concentration in U.S. telecom without clearly better risk\u2011adjusted returns than T.\n- Market read via BRK-B and blue chips: BRK-B at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, alongside many blue\u2011chip staples and mega\u2011cap tech on rich multiples, points to a broad U.S. large\u2011cap market that is fair\u2011to\u2011expensive, not distressed. Our best edge remains in name\u2011specific value (PFE, T) and holding a high\u2011quality anchor (BRK-B), not in buying broad beta at current levels.\n\n6) Portfolio\u2011level view\n- Approximate mix at today\u2019s prices: PFE ~38% of equity (value + high yield in pharma), T ~33% (value + yield in telecom, leverage risk), BRK-B ~28% (quality compounding anchor), cash ~10\u201311% (dry powder).\n- None of the holdings appears overvalued or impaired; all still trade at reasonable to attractive multiples given their quality and risk.\n- The current opportunity set, given tool limitations on smaller caps and broadly full valuations in large caps, does not offer a clearly superior, high\u2011conviction new idea that would improve the portfolio\u2019s risk/return or diversification versus simply holding our existing positions plus cash.\n- Within a margin\u2011of\u2011safety, concentrated value framework, it is better to remain patient and preserve cash for a genuine dislocation than to force activity or stack additional exposure to similar risks (e.g., adding VZ alongside T).\n"

At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, it still looks like fair value, not a deep\u2011value fat pitch or a sell. No sign of franchise or balance\u2011sheet deterioration.\n\n4) New idea work\n- Screener (US, mkt cap $0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u22658, sector=ALL, limit=30) again surfaced mostly large, well\u2011known franchises: BRK\u2011B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL. Most of these trade at high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es, i.e., quality at a full price rather than clear deep value.\n- Verizon (VZ) spot\u2011check: Price $40.73; 52w $37.59\u2013$47.36. TTM P/E ~8.7; forward P/E ~8.5; P/B ~1.63; P/S ~1.25; EV/EBITDA ~6.8; dividend yield ~6.8%. Profit margin ~14.4%; ROE ~19.9%; ROA ~5.2%; but debt/equity ~165% and current/quick ratios 0.74/0.57\u2014an even more leveraged balance sheet than T with similar business risk. It\u2019s a classic value telecom but not clearly superior to T; owning both would simply stack more U.S. telecom leverage.\n- CSWI and WBA: Fresh calls for price and ratios continue to return null/empty data for all key metrics, so I cannot responsibly form a valuation\u2011based thesis.\n- Market context via BRK\u2011B and blue chips: BRK\u2011B at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, plus many staples and mega\u2011cap tech names on rich multiples, supports a view of a broad U.S. large\u2011cap market that is fair\u2011to\u2011expensive, not distressed. Our clearest bargains remain idiosyncratic (PFE, T) rather than broad beta.\n\n5) Portfolio\u2011level view\n- Approximate mix at current prices: PFE ~38% of equity; T ~33%; BRK\u2011B ~28%; cash ~10\u201311%. None of the holdings appears overvalued or impaired; all still trade at reasonable to attractive multiples given their quality and risk. The current idea set does not provide a new, data\u2011supported, clearly superior value opportunity that would improve risk/return or diversification versus our existing positions plus cash. Within a patient, concentrated, margin\u2011of\u2011safety value framework, keeping this structure and holding cash for a genuine dislocation remains the best course."

            "notes": "Key updates as of 2026-01-02 (last close data):\n\n1) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Price & valuation: Price ~$24.90 (52w: $20.92\u2013$27.69), modestly below our ~$25.77 entry and in the upper half of the 52-week range. Ratios: TTM P/E ~14.5; forward P/E ~8.3; P/B ~1.53; P/S ~2.25; EV/EBITDA ~7.7; dividend yield ~6.9%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~15.7%; ROE ~10.6%; ROA ~5.2%; debt/equity ~66.5%; current ratio ~1.28; quick ~0.90. This remains a solid, moderately levered large-cap pharma profile; no new stress in leverage or liquidity.\n- 1-year price action: The stock spent much of the year in the low/mid-20s, sold off to the ~$21 area in spring, then recovered to a ~$26\u201327 high in October before pulling back and consolidating around $25. Recent trading (~$25) is slightly below our entry but within the same value zone we underwrote.\n- Insider activity: Recent tape still dominated by large option/RSU-related exercises at higher historical strike prices (~$30\u201331) by senior executives (including the CEO) and one modest officer sale (~2,500 shares at ~$25.93). The standout remains the February 2025 open-market director purchase of ~19,457 shares at ~$25.65 (~$0.5M) \u2013 almost exactly today\u2019s price \u2013 which is a strong alignment signal. No pattern of heavy open-market insider selling at or below current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest snapshot unchanged vs prior months: 3 Strong Buy, 7 Buy, 15 Hold, 1 Sell. This continues to frame PFE as a value/normalization story with execution risk, not a broken business.\n- Thesis check: Our thesis was to own a large, diversified pharma on a single-digit forward P/E with a high, covered ~6\u20137% yield, where the post-COVID earnings reset and pipeline risk are already largely discounted. Today\u2019s metrics (forward P/E ~8.3, ~6.9% yield, mid-teens margins, double-digit ROE, moderate leverage) are essentially identical to what we originally saw. Price is a few percent below entry, slightly improving margin of safety, but PFE is already our largest position (~high-30s% of equity). The incremental discount is not large enough to justify further concentration. \n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation: Price ~$24.84 (52w: $21.38\u2013$29.79), in the mid-range, well below the high, and essentially at our ~$24.84 entry. Ratios: TTM P/E ~8.1; forward P/E ~11.1; P/B ~1.60; P/S ~1.43; EV/EBITDA ~7.5; dividend yield ~4.5%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%; debt/equity ~124%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71. Classic heavily levered but cash-generative U.S. telecom; leverage remains the central structural risk, but the metrics are stable versus prior months.\n- 1-year price action: T rallied from low-20s to high-20s earlier in the year, then pulled back into the mid-20s. Over the last month it drifted from high-$25s/low-$26s into the low-$24s and has since stabilized around $24.8. This is a cooling of earlier optimism, not a collapse or clear sign of new bad news.\n- Insider activity: Recent filings continue to show stock grants/awards and related entries for CEO, CFO, COO and other executives at ~$24.75\u201326.02, plus some stock gifts; there are no notable open-market insider sales. This is neutral to mildly positive: compensation is being set around today\u2019s trading range, with no insider rush to sell.\n- Street sentiment: Latest recommendations remain broadly constructive: 4 Strong Buy, 12 Buy, 9 Hold, 0 Sell (very similar to last month). No sign of a downgrade wave.\n- Thesis check: We own T as a low-multiple, cash-flow-heavy telecom with a reset, more sustainable dividend, where investors collect a mid-single-digit yield while modest deleveraging and stable wireless/broadband cash flows allow for some multiple normalization off a depressed ~8x earnings base. Today\u2019s metrics (8x trailing P/E, ~11x forward, ~4.5% yield, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, high but steady leverage) still fit this story. The stock is roughly at our entry price and already ~one-third of equity; the valuation has not moved to a dramatically better bargain that would justify even more exposure to a single highly levered telecom.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price & valuation: Price ~$502.65 (52w: $440.10\u2013$542.07), in the upper half of the range and ~7\u20138% below the high; slightly above our ~$497 entry. Ratios: TTM P/E ~16.1; forward P/E ~20.8 (noisy given the mark-to-market nature of investment income); P/S ~2.91. The reported P/B (~0.001) is a data artifact; in reality Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book. No dividend.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55. This remains a fortress balance sheet with diversified operating businesses plus a very large cash and marketable-securities portfolio.\n- 1-year price action: Steady appreciation into the low/mid-500s, a peak above $540, then a pullback and tight consolidation in the high-400s/low-500s. Over the last month it has traded in a narrow range around $500 with low volatility \u2013 characteristic of a fairly valued compounder.\n- Insider activity: As usual, activity is dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring charitable stock gifts (millions of shares at $0 in filings) and small gifts by directors. Ajit Jain sold ~15,000 shares at roughly $500 in late September and ~2,000 shares at ~465 earlier in the year, along with several tiny gifts. This behavior is consistent with long-standing patterns; there is no new insider buying or selling that would signal a shift in intrinsic value.\n- Street sentiment: Very light coverage and stable: 0 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 2 Hold, 0 Sell. Analysts continue to treat Berkshire as a high-quality, fairly valued compounding vehicle.\n- Thesis check: We hold BRK-B as a high-quality, diversified, low-leverage compounding anchor in a market that is broadly fair-to-rich. At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52-week range, it still looks like fair value rather than a deep-value opportunity. There is no sign of franchise or balance-sheet deterioration. It remains appropriate as a core anchor, but not cheap enough to overweight.\n\n4) New idea scan and broader market read\n- Screener results: Running a screen for US stocks with market cap ~$0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, and ROE \u22658 again returns a familiar list of very large, widely followed names: BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL. Many of these (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent businesses but trade on high-teens to mid-20s P/Es \u2013 \u2018quality at a full price\u2019 rather than \u2018obvious discount to intrinsic value.\u2019\n- Data-gapped tickers (CSWI, WBA): As in prior days, calls for price/ratios/history on CSWI and WBA return incomplete or null data in this environment, which prevents a responsible intrinsic-value assessment. Without basic quantitative information, they cannot be added as high-conviction value ideas.\n- Verizon (VZ) peer check: VZ continues to look like a classic value telecom: price low-$40s, TTM P/E ~8.6, forward P/E ~8.4, P/B ~1.6, P/S ~1.2, EV/EBITDA ~6.7, dividend yield ~6.8%, with profit margin ~14.4%, ROE ~19.9%, ROA ~5.2%. However, leverage is even higher than T (debt/equity ~165%, weaker current/quick ratios). It is not clearly superior to T; buying it would simply increase concentration in leveraged U.S. telecom with very similar risk factors.\n- Market context via BRK-B and peers: BRK-B at ~16x earnings, near the upper half of its range, and many large-cap staples and mega-cap tech names on rich multiples all support the view that the broad U.S. large-cap market is fair-to-expensive, not distressed. Our clearest bargains remain specific idiosyncratic cases (PFE, T) plus the quality anchor (BRK-B), not broad market beta.\n\n5) Portfolio-level view\n- Approximate structure at current prices: PFE ~38% of equity (value + high yield in large-cap pharma), T ~33% (value + yield in telecom, with leverage risk), BRK-B ~28% (high-quality diversified compounding anchor), cash ~10\u201311% (dry powder).\n- None of the three holdings appears overvalued on fundamentals or impaired; all still trade at reasonable to attractive multiples relative to their business quality and risk.\n- The current idea set, given tool limitations on less-followed names and generally full valuations among big liquid names, does not present a new, clearly superior high-conviction value opportunity that would meaningfully improve the portfolio\u2019s risk/return or diversification.\n- In a margin-of-safety, concentrated value framework, it is preferable to maintain current positions and hold cash for a genuine dislocation rather than force activity or stack additional exposure to already-represented risk buckets (e.g., adding another highly levered telecom)."

Recent trading around $25 is essentially the same value zone we underwrote.\n- Insider & Street:\n  \u2022 Recent insider tape still dominated by large option/RSU exercises at higher historical strikes (~$30\u201331) and one modest officer sale (~2,500 shares @ ~$25.93). The key positive signal remains the Feb 2025 open-market director buy of ~19,457 shares @ ~$25.65 (~$0.5M), very close to today\u2019s price.\n  \u2022 Analyst recommendations stable: latest snapshot 3 Strong Buy, 7 Buy, 15 Hold, 1 Sell (unchanged vs prior months).\n- Thesis check: We own PFE as a large, diversified pharma on a single-digit forward P/E with a high, covered yield, where much of the post-COVID earnings reset and pipeline risk is already priced in. Today\u2019s metrics (fwd P/E ~8.4, ~6.8% yield, mid-teens margins, ~10% ROE, moderate leverage) remain in line with that thesis, and the stock sits modestly below our entry.

Current level is a cooled-off, not-panicked, mid-range price.\n- Insider & Street:\n  \u2022 Recent insider activity is overwhelmingly stock awards and related entries for CEO/CFO/COO and other executives at ~$24.75\u2013$26.02, plus some stock gifts; no notable open-market insider selling.\n  \u2022 Analyst stance still constructive: latest snapshot 4 Strong Buy, 12 Buy, 9 Hold, 0 Sell, very similar to previous months.\n- Thesis check: We own T as a low-multiple, cash-flow-heavy telecom with a right-sized dividend where investors collect a mid-single-digit yield while modest deleveraging and stable wireless/broadband cash flows could allow some multiple normalization off an ~8x earnings base. Today\u2019s metrics (P/E ~8x trailing, ~11x forward, ~4.5% yield, EV/EBITDA ~7.5, leverage high but steady) still fit that thesis. The stock is only marginally below our entry and already roughly one-third of equity; the valuation is still attractive, but not at a dramatically better bargain level that would justify increasing exposure to a single, highly levered telecom. \u2192 HOLD.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price & valuation: $498.52 (52w: $440.10\u2013$542.07), in the upper half of the range and ~8% below the high; slightly above our ~$497 entry.\n  \u2022 TTM P/E: 15.95; forward P/E: ~20.6 (noisy given mark-to-market effects)\n  \u2022 P/S: 2.89; reported P/B (~0.001) is a data artifact; economically, Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book\n  \u2022 Dividend: none\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin: ~18.1%; ROE: ~10.2%; ROA: ~4.8%\n  \u2022 Debt/equity: ~18.2%; current ratio: ~2.72; quick ratio: ~2.55\n  \u2192 Fortress balance sheet with diversified, high-quality operating businesses and a large cash/marketable-securities portfolio.\n- Price action (1y): Gradual appreciation into new highs above $540, followed by a measured pullback and tight trading range in the high-$490s/low-$500s. Very low volatility, consistent with a fairly valued compounder.\n- Insider & Street:\n  \u2022 Insider tape remains Buffett\u2019s recurring large charitable stock gifts and small gifts plus occasional sales by Ajit Jain (the notable recent sale ~15,000 shares around $500 in Sept 2025). This pattern is long-standing and not a new signal.\n  \u2022 Analyst coverage remains light and stable: latest snapshot 0 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 2 Hold, 0 Sell.\n- Thesis check: We hold BRK-B as a high-quality, diversified compounding anchor in a broadly fair-to-rich market, accepting a fair mid-teens P/E in exchange for quality and balance-sheet strength. At ~16x earnings and in the upper half of its 52-week range, Berkshire still looks like fair value rather than a deep-value fat pitch or an obvious sell. \u2192 HOLD as core anchor; not cheap enough to add, no reason to trim.\n\n4) Market & new idea scan\n- Value screen (US, market cap $0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8, sector=ALL, limit=30) again returns a familiar list of mostly large, widely followed names: CSWI, BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n  \u2022 Many (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent franchises but typically trade at high-teens to mid-20s P/Es, i.e., quality at a full price, not obvious deep value with a wide margin of safety.\n  \u2022 Underfollowed candidates like CSWI and WBA continue to have incomplete/null data in this tool environment for price/ratios/history, preventing a responsible valuation-based thesis.\n- Telecom peer: Verizon (VZ) remains a classic value telecom: low P/E and high yield, but with even higher leverage and weaker liquidity than T. Fundamentals (profit margin, ROE/ROA) are okay, but debt/equity is ~165% vs T\u2019s ~124%, and business risk is very similar. Adding VZ would simply increase concentration in U.S. telecom with no clearly superior risk/return versus T.\n- Market context via BRK-B and blue chips: BRK-B at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its range, alongside many staples and mega-cap tech on rich multiples, signals a broad U.S. large-cap market that is fair-to-expensive, not distressed. Our clearest bargains remain idiosyncratic names like PFE and T (single-digit to low-teens forward P/Es and solid yields) plus the Berkshire anchor, rather than broad index-like exposure.\n\n5) Portfolio-level view\n- Approximate structure at current prices (using earlier share counts and latest quotes; exact cash unknown due to portfolio-tool auth error but ~10\u201311%):\n  \u2022 PFE: ~38% of equity \u2013 value + high yield in large-cap pharma\n  \u2022 T: ~33% of equity \u2013 value + income in telecom, with leverage as key risk\n  \u2022 BRK-B: ~28% of equity \u2013 high-quality diversified compounding anchor\n  \u2022 Cash: ~10\u201311% \u2013 dry powder\n- None of the holdings appears overvalued or impaired on current fundamentals; all still trade at reasonable-to-attractive multiples given their quality and risk. The screen and follow-up checks do not surface a new, clearly superior high-conviction idea with better margin of safety and diversification than our existing mix plus cash.\n- In a concentrated, margin-of-safety value framework, maintaining current positions and holding cash for a genuine dislocation is preferable to forcing activity or layering more exposure into already-represented risk buckets (e.g., more leveraged telecom)."

Latest move to $25.43 keeps it in the same value zone we underwrote.\n- Insider activity: Still dominated by large option/derivative exercises at much higher strikes (~$30\u201331) and one modest officer sale (~2,500 shares @ ~$25.93). The key alignment signal remains the Feb 2025 open-market purchase by director Ronald Blaylock (~19,457 shares @ ~$25.65, \u2248$0.5M), very close to today\u2019s price. No wave of insider selling at or below current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest recommendations unchanged vs recent months: 3 Strong Buy, 7 Buy, 15 Hold, 1 Sell.\n- Thesis check: PFE remains a large, diversified pharma trading at a single-digit forward P/E with a high, covered yield, where post-COVID normalization and pipeline risk appear largely discounted. Profitability and the balance sheet are stable. The stock is only slightly above recent mid-$25 prints and modestly below our entry, so the margin of safety is similar to what we originally underwrote. PFE is already our largest position (~high\u201130s% of equity), so the incremental upside from adding at roughly the same valuation is not worth further concentration. \u2192 HOLD.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Today\u2019s snapshot:\n  \u2022 Price: $24.34 (52w: $21.38\u2013$29.79), mid-range and slightly below our ~$24.84 entry.\n  \u2022 Valuation: TTM P/E ~7.9; forward P/E ~10.9; P/B ~1.56; P/S ~1.40; EV/EBITDA ~7.45; dividend yield ~4.6%.\n  \u2022 Quality: profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%; debt/equity ~124%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71.\n- Price action (last month): Drift from high-$25s/low-$26s down into low-$24s, then a small bounce and stabilization around the mid-$24s. This is a controlled cooling of prior optimism, not an event-driven collapse.\n- Insider activity: Recent filings show stock awards and related entries for CEO/CFO/COO and other executives at ~$24.75\u201326.02, plus some stock gifts. No meaningful open-market insider selling. This is neutral to mildly positive\u2014compensation aligns with current trading levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest snapshot now shows 4 Strong Buy, 12 Buy, 8 Hold, 1 Sell (vs 0 sells previously). This is a minor softening but still a broadly constructive stance.\n- Thesis check: T remains a low-multiple, cash-flow-heavy telecom with a reset, more sustainable dividend, where shareholders earn a mid-single-digit yield while modest deleveraging and stable wireless/broadband cash flows can support some multiple normalization from an ~8x earnings base. Valuation (8x trailing P/E, ~11x forward, EV/EBITDA ~7.5) and leverage metrics are essentially unchanged; the stock is just under our entry and already roughly one\u2011third of equity. The main risk is still structural leverage, not price. Adding more here would increase exposure to a single highly levered name without a materially larger discount than when we initiated. \u2192 HOLD.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Today\u2019s snapshot:\n  \u2022 Price: $499.05 (52w: $440.10\u2013$542.07), in the upper half of the range and ~8% below the high; slightly above our ~$497 entry.\n  \u2022 Valuation: TTM P/E ~15.95; forward P/E ~20.6 (noisy); P/S ~2.89. Reported P/B (~0.001) is a data artefact\u2014economically Berkshire usually trades at a modest premium to book. No dividend.\n  \u2022 Quality: profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55.\n- Price action (last month): Very tight band high-$490s to low-$500s; low volatility typical of a fairly valued, high-quality compounder.\n- Insider activity: As usual, activity is dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring charitable gifts (multi-million-share transfers) and small gifts/sales by Ajit Jain (notably ~15,000 shares @ ~$500 in Sept 2025 and a smaller sale earlier). This pattern is long-standing and not a new negative signal.\n- Street sentiment: Light and stable coverage\u20140 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 2 Hold, 0 Sell.\n- Thesis check: BRK-B still fits its role as our high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor in a broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich market. At ~16x earnings in the upper half of its 52w range, it looks like fair value, not a deep\u2011value bargain or an obvious sell. There is no evidence of balance-sheet or business deterioration. Trimming here to chase marginally cheaper but lower-quality or more leveraged ideas would reduce portfolio robustness. \u2192 HOLD.\n\n5) New idea scan and broader market context\n- Screener (US, market cap $0.5\u2013$5B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8, sector=ALL, limit=30) again returned a largely unchanged list of widely followed names: CSWI, BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL. Most of these\u2014especially staples and mega-cap tech\u2014trade at high-teens to mid\u201120s P/Es, which is \"+quality at a full price\" rather than \"deep value with a wide margin of safety.\"\n- Underfollowed names such as CSWI and WBA still fail to return complete price/ratio/history data in this tool environment, preventing a disciplined quantitative valuation. Without basic fundamentals, we cannot responsibly underwrite them.\n- Telecom peer VZ continues to look like a classic value telecom (low P/E, high yield) but with even higher leverage and weaker liquidity than T; adding it would simply stack more U.S. telecom leverage without a clearly superior risk/return profile.\n- Market read via BRK-B and blue chips: With Berkshire at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its range, and many large-cap staples and mega-cap tech names at rich multiples, the broad U.S. large-cap market appears fair\u2011to\u2011expensive, not distressed. Our best opportunities remain idiosyncratic value cases (PFE, T) plus the Berkshire anchor\u2014not broad beta.\n\n6) Overall assessment\n- Portfolio remains a concentrated, three\u2011stock barbell: PFE (value + high yield in diversified pharma), T (value + yield in telecom with leverage risk), and BRK\u2011B (high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor), plus roughly 10\u201311% cash.\n- None of the holdings is overvalued or impaired based on today\u2019s data; all still offer reasonable to attractive value for their quality and risk.\n- The current opportunity set does not present a new, clearly superior, data\u2011supported value idea that would meaningfully improve expected risk/return or diversification versus holding the current mix and cash.\n- In line with classic value-investing principles\u2014margin of safety, quality over quantity, and patience\u2014the best move is inaction: keep current positions and preserve cash for a genuine dislocation rather than force activity."

TTM P/E ~14.7, forward P/E ~8.5, P/B ~1.55, P/S ~2.29, EV/EBITDA ~7.8. Dividend yield ~6.8%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~15.7%, ROE ~10.6%, ROA ~5.2%. Debt/equity ~66.5%, current ratio ~1.28, quick ~0.90. Still a solid, moderately levered large-cap pharma; no new stress evident.\n- Price action (1m): Range-bound mid-$20s. Spike to ~$26.4 on 12/15, sharp but contained pullback on 12/16, then consolidation mostly ~$25\u201325.5. Today\u2019s price sits in that same zone.\n- Insider & Street: Insider tape remains dominated by older (early-2025) option/RSU exercises at much higher strikes (~$30\u201331) plus a small sale (~2,500 sh @ ~$25.93). The standout positive remains the Feb 2025 director open-market buy of ~19,457 shares at ~$25.65 (~$0.5M), right around today\u2019s price. Analyst mix unchanged: 3 Strong Buy, 7 Buy, 15 Hold, 1 Sell.\n- Thesis status: Still a large, diversified pharma trading at single-digit forward P/E with a high, covered yield; post-COVID normalization and pipeline risk appear largely priced in. Today\u2019s metrics and business quality look essentially identical to what we underwrote; the stock is a bit below our entry, slightly improving margin of safety. Already our largest position (~high-30s% of equity), so the modest discount is not sufficient to justify larger concentration. \u2192 HOLD.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation: $23.97 vs our ~$24.84 entry (unrealized loss ~3\u20134%). 52w range $21.38\u201329.79 (mid-range, well below high). TTM P/E ~7.8, forward P/E ~10.7, P/B ~1.54, P/S ~1.38, EV/EBITDA ~7.4. Dividend yield ~4.6%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%, ROE ~19.1%, ROA ~4.0%. Debt/equity ~124%, current ratio ~1.01, quick ~0.71. Classic highly levered but cash-generative telecom; leverage remains the central structural risk, but metrics are stable.\n- Price action (1m): Gradual drift from high-$25s/low-$26s into low-$24s, now at $23.97 (slightly below the recent $24\u201324.5 consolidation). Looks like cooling optimism after a prior run, not a panic.\n- Insider & Street: Recent insider activity remains stock awards/grants around $24.8\u201326.0 for CEO, CFO, COO, and other execs; no meaningful open-market selling. Latest analyst snapshot: 4 Strong Buy, 12 Buy, 8 Hold, 1 Sell (slight softening vs 0 sells previously but still broadly constructive).\n- Thesis status: We own T as a low-multiple, cash-flow-heavy telecom with a reset, more sustainable dividend. Investors collect ~4.5\u20134.6% yield while modest deleveraging and stable wireless/broadband cash flows can allow some multiple normalization off ~8x trailing earnings. Today\u2019s valuation and balance-sheet profile remain consistent; the stock is modestly below entry, offering a bit more value, but T is already roughly one-third of equity and the key risk (high leverage) is unchanged. Not cheap enough, nor thesis-improved enough, to warrant further concentration. \u2192 HOLD.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price & valuation: $496.12 vs our ~$497.23 entry (essentially flat). 52w range $440.10\u2013542.07 (upper half, ~8% below high). TTM P/E ~15.9, forward P/E ~20.5 (noisy), P/S ~2.88; reported P/B (~0.001) is a known data artefact; in reality Berkshire trades at a modest premium to book. No dividend.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%, ROE ~10.2%, ROA ~4.8%. Debt/equity ~18.2%, current ratio ~2.72, quick ~2.55. Fortress balance sheet and diversified, high-quality earnings base.\n- Price action (1m): Very tight band high-$490s to low-$500s, modestly below the 52w high; low volatility, typical of a fairly valued compounder consolidating.\n- Insider & Street: Insider tape remains dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s recurring large charitable gifts and small gifts/sales by Ajit Jain (notably ~15k shares sold around $500 in Sept 2025). No new unusual insider buying or selling. Analyst coverage is light and unchanged: 0 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 2 Hold, 0 Sell.\n- Thesis status: Still our high-quality, diversified compounding anchor in a broadly fair-to-rich market. At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52w range, BRK-B looks like fair value, not a deep-value fat pitch or an obvious source of funds. No evidence of business or balance-sheet deterioration. \u2192 HOLD.\n\n4) New idea scan & market conditions\n- Screener (US, $0.5\u201320B mkt cap, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8%) again surfaced mostly large, widely followed names (BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL). Many of these\u2014especially staples and mega-cap tech\u2014trade at high-teens to mid-20s P/Es, which is quality at a full price rather than clear deep value.\n- CSWI and WBA: Fresh calls for price and ratios again returned null for all key fields (price, market cap, P/E, ROE, etc.), so we still lack the basic quantitative foundation for a disciplined intrinsic-value thesis. They remain uninvestable within this framework until data are available.\n- Verizon (VZ) as peer: Earlier data (still current) show VZ at low-$40s with TTM P/E ~8.6, forward P/E ~8.4, P/B ~1.6, EV/EBITDA ~6.7, dividend yield ~6.8%, but with even higher leverage than T (debt/equity ~165%, weaker liquidity). It is another classic value telecom, not clearly superior to T; owning both would just increase concentration in U.S. telecom without a better risk/return profile.\n- Market read via BRK-B & blue chips: Berkshire at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its range, plus many staples and mega-cap tech on rich multiples, suggests the broad U.S. large-cap market is fair-to-expensive, not distressed. Our edge remains in name-specific value (PFE, T) and a quality anchor (BRK-B), not broad beta at today\u2019s prices.\n\n5) Portfolio-level view & cash\n- Using today\u2019s prices and known share counts: equity in PFE (~135.8 sh), T (~120.8 sh), and BRK-B (~5.0 sh) is roughly in the high-$8k range, vs $10k starting capital and recent NAVs just under $10k. This implies we still hold on the order of $1.0\u20131.2k in cash (~10\u201312% of the portfolio), consistent with prior days.\n- Approximate mix: PFE ~38% of equity (value + high yield in large-cap pharma), T ~33% (value + yield in telecom with leverage risk), BRK-B ~28% (high-quality diversified compounding anchor), cash ~10\u201312% (dry powder).\n- None of the holdings is overvalued on fundamentals or showing tool-visible impairment; all continue to trade at reasonable-to-attractive valuations given their quality and risks. The current opportunity set does not surface a new, clearly superior high-conviction idea that offers a better margin of safety and diversification than simply maintaining our three positions plus cash.\n- In line with a concentrated, margin-of-safety value strategy, it is preferable to be patient and keep cash available for a genuine dislocation rather than force activity or add more exposure to already-represented risk buckets (e.g., another highly levered telecom)."

These remain fully consistent with the thesis.\n  - The price is ~4\u20135% below our entry, so the valuation is a bit better, but not a dramatic dislocation.\n  - T is already roughly one\u2011third of portfolio equity; adding here would materially increase exposure to a single highly levered telecom without a correspondingly large increase in margin of safety.\n  \u2192 Assessment: Thesis intact; valuation still cheap, but leverage risk and existing size argue against adding.

Recent closes hover just below our entry.\n- Interpretation: Still a large, diversified pharma on a single-digit forward P/E with a high, covered yield and a reasonable balance sheet. Business and valuation look essentially identical to prior weeks; price is modestly below entry but not at a dramatically different level. As our largest position, the slightly better price does not justify more concentration.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price: $23.30 (entry ~$24.84; unrealized loss mid-single-digits). 52w range: $21.84\u2013$29.79 (mid-range, well below high).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E 7.59; forward P/E 10.46; P/B 1.50; P/S 1.34; EV/EBITDA 7.29; dividend yield ~4.76%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%; debt/equity ~124.4%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71.\n- 1-month price action: Gradual drift down from mid-$24s into low-$23s; behavior consistent with cooling optimism rather than a sudden, thesis-changing event.\n- Interpretation: Classic value telecom profile: low earnings multiple, decent yield, but very high leverage. The lower price improves valuation somewhat (P/E now ~7.6x), yet the core risk (leverage) and business profile are unchanged, and T is already a large position. The discount vs our entry is not big enough, nor the information set improved enough, to justify adding more leverage-heavy telecom exposure.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price: $495.24 (entry ~$497.23; roughly flat). 52w range: $453.27\u2013$542.07 (upper half, ~9% below high).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E 15.85; forward P/E 20.47 (noisy); P/B reported ~0.001 (known data artifact); P/S 2.87; EV/EBITDA not very meaningful due to conglomerate structure and cash/securities.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55.\n- 1-month price action: Very tight band around $495\u2013505 with low volatility; no sign of stress or euphoria.\n- Interpretation: Still a high-quality, diversified compounding vehicle at roughly fair value (~16x earnings) with a fortress balance sheet. Appropriately serves as our quality anchor; not cheap enough to add aggressively, not expensive or impaired enough to trim.\n\n4) Portfolio & cash (approximate)\n- Using current prices and known share counts: equity value in PFE, T, and BRK-B is around the high-$8k range. Against $10k starting capital, this implies roughly $1.0\u20131.2k in cash (~10\u201312% of the portfolio), consistent with prior nav history and absence of trades.\n- Structure: PFE ~38% of equity (value + high yield in pharma), T ~32\u201333% (value + yield in telecom with leverage risk), BRK-B ~28\u201329% (quality compounding anchor), plus ~10\u201312% cash.\n\n5) New idea scan / market context\n- Screener (US, $0.3\u20135B market cap, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u22658%, all sectors, limit 30) returned the same familiar large, widely followed names as before: CSWI, BRK-B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n- Many (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent businesses but generally trade at high-teens to mid-20s P/Es \u2013 quality at a full price, not obvious deep value.\n- Underfollowed names like CSWI and WBA continue to suffer from incomplete data in this tool environment, preventing basic valuation analysis.\n- Verizon (VZ), from recent checks, remains a classic value telecom (low P/E, high yield) but with even higher leverage and weaker liquidity than T, and similar business risk. Adding it would just stack more U.S. telecom leverage without a clearly superior risk/return profile.\n- Market read via BRK-B and blue chips: Berkshire at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its 52-week range, plus staples and mega-cap tech on rich multiples, indicates a broad U.S. large-cap market that is fair-to-expensive rather than distressed. Our relative bargains remain idiosyncratic (PFE, T) rather than broad index-like beta.\n\nOverall: No holding shows fundamental deterioration or an overvaluation problem; no new screened name offers a clearly better margin of safety and diversification than our existing three plus cash. In this context, patience and selectivity remain appropriate."

Still a solid, moderately levered large\u2011cap pharma.\n- 1\u2011month action: Range\u2011bound mid\u2011$20s; spike to ~26.4 mid\u2011Dec, sharp but contained pullback on 12/16, consolidation around $25\u201326, now slightly above recent closes. Volatility but no new obvious trend.\n- Insider/Street: Insider tape still dominated by early\u20112025 option exercises at higher strikes (~$30\u201331) and one small officer sale (~2,500 sh @ $25.93). The key positive signal remains the Feb\u20112025 open\u2011market director buy (~19,457 sh @ ~$25.65, ~0.5M USD), near today\u2019s price. Latest analyst mix unchanged at 3 Strong Buy / 7 Buy / 15 Hold / 1 Sell.\n- Thesis check: Our case is a large, diversified pharma at single\u2011digit forward P/E with a high, covered yield, where post\u2011COVID normalization and pipeline risk are largely in the price. Today\u2019s metrics are almost identical to what we underwrote; business quality and balance sheet look stable. Price is close to our entry (~25.77). PFE is already the largest position (~high\u201130s% of equity). Marginal change in valuation doesn\u2019t justify further concentration. Action: HOLD.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation (today): $23.61; 52w range $21.84\u2013$29.79 (mid\u2011range, well below high; modestly below our ~$24.84 entry).

Classic heavily levered but cash\u2011generative telecom; leverage remains the primary structural risk, but the numbers are stable.\n- 1\u2011month action: Drifted down from mid\u2011$24s into the low\u2011$23s, with a small recent bounce; looks like cooling of prior optimism rather than an event\u2011driven selloff. 1\u2011month chart shows a gentle downtrend, not a collapse.\n- Insider/Street: Recent filings remain dominated by stock awards to CEO/CFO/COO and other execs around ~$24.8\u201326.0, plus related entries; no large open\u2011market insider selling. Latest analyst snapshot: 4 Strong Buy / 12 Buy / 8 Hold / 1 Sell (slightly softer than 0 sells previously, but still broadly constructive).\n- Thesis check: We own T as a low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom with a reset, more sustainable dividend; investors collect a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield while modest deleveraging and stable wireless/broadband cash flows can support some re\u2011rating from an ~8x earnings base. Current metrics (P/E ~7.7x trailing, ~10.6x forward, EV/EBITDA ~7.3, ~4.7% yield, high but steady leverage) still fit that thesis. The stock is ~5% below our entry, so valuation is slightly more attractive, but not dramatically different, and T already represents roughly one\u2011third of equity. Adding more here would materially increase exposure to a single highly leveraged telecom without a correspondingly larger margin of safety.

Fortress balance sheet with diversified, high\u2011quality operating businesses and a very large cash/marketable\u2011securities portfolio.\n- 1\u2011month action: Very tight band high\u2011$490s to low\u2011$500s, with a slight drift down to ~$493; low volatility, typical of a fairly priced compounder consolidating below its highs.\n- Insider/Street: Pattern unchanged\u2014Buffett\u2019s large recurring charitable stock gifts (multi\u2011million\u2011share transfers) and small gifts/sales by Ajit Jain (e.g., ~15k sh @ ~$500 in Sept\u20112025), with no new buying or selling out of pattern. Analyst coverage remains light and stable at 0 Strong Buy / 2 Buy / 2 Hold / 0 Sell.\n- Thesis check: We hold BRK\u2011B as a high\u2011quality, diversified compounding anchor in a broadly fair\u2011to\u2011rich market. At ~16x trailing earnings and in the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, it still looks like fair value, not a deep\u2011value opportunity nor an obvious sell. Business quality and balance sheet remain intact. Action: HOLD.\n\n4) Market & opportunity set\n- Screener (US, $0.5\u201320B market cap, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8%) again returns mainly large, widely followed franchises: CSWI, BRK\u2011B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, WBA, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL.\n  \u2022 Many of these (KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, etc.) are excellent businesses but typically trade at high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es\u2014quality at a full price rather than clearly cheap with a wide margin of safety.\n  \u2022 Underfollowed tickers like CSWI and WBA continue to have incomplete or null data in this tool environment for key fields (price, P/E, ROE, etc.), which prevents disciplined valuation work.\n  \u2022 Verizon (VZ) remains a value\u2011ish U.S. telecom peer: low P/E and high yield, but with even higher leverage (debt/equity ~165%) and weaker liquidity than T, and broadly similar business risk. It\u2019s not clearly superior to T; owning both would just increase concentration in leveraged U.S. telecom.\n- Market context: BRK\u2011B at ~16x earnings in the upper half of its range, plus staples and mega\u2011cap tech on rich multiples, indicates a broad U.S. large\u2011cap market that is fair\u2011to\u2011expensive, not distressed. Our clearest bargains remain idiosyncratic\u2014PFE and T\u2014rather than broad index\u2011like beta.\n\n5) Portfolio\u2011level view\n- Using the latest prices and known share counts, equity in PFE (~135.8 sh), T (~120.8 sh), and BRK\u2011B (~5.0 sh) is in the high\u2011$8k range versus $10k starting capital; with no executed trades, the portfolio still holds roughly $1.0\u20131.2k in cash (~10\u201312%).\n- Approximate mix: PFE ~38% of equity (value + high yield in large\u2011cap pharma), T ~33% (value + yield in telecom, leverage\u2011heavy), BRK\u2011B ~28\u201329% (high\u2011quality diversified compounding anchor), and ~10\u201312% cash.\n- None of the holdings is overvalued on fundamentals or showing tool\u2011visible deterioration; all still offer reasonable\u2011to\u2011attractive value relative to their quality and risk. The current opportunity set, given data limitations on smaller caps and full valuations among many blue chips, does not present a new, clearly superior high\u2011conviction idea that would materially improve expected risk/return or diversification relative to holding current positions plus cash.\n- In a concentrated, margin\u2011of\u2011safety\u2011driven value framework, the best move is patience: continue to hold the three existing positions and preserve cash as dry powder for a future dislocation, rather than force new trades or increase exposure to already\u2011represented risks (e.g., more leveraged telecom)."

Today\u2019s price is slightly above recent closes but within the same consolidation band we\u2019ve seen for weeks.\n- Interpretation: Still a large, diversified pharma at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a high, seemingly covered yield, solid profitability, and moderate leverage. No tool\u2011visible sign of fundamental deterioration. Given PFE is already the largest position, there\u2019s no valuation expansion or thesis change that would justify trimming; nor is the stock cheap enough relative to our existing size to justify adding.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price: $23.73 (entry ~$24.84), 52w: $21.98\u2013$29.79 (mid\u2011range, well below high).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E 7.73; forward P/E 10.65; P/B 1.52; P/S 1.36; EV/EBITDA ~7.36; dividend yield ~4.68%.\n- Quality: Profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%; debt/equity ~124.4%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71.\n- 1\u2011month action: Gentle downtrend from mid\u2011$24s into the high\u2011$23s; no panic volume or event\u2011driven collapse. Recent dividend payment (seen in the history) is consistent with the yield metrics.\n- Interpretation: Classic value telecom\u2014low P/E, decent yield, but with substantial leverage. The lower price has made it a bit cheaper than our entry, but not by a margin so large that it changes the risk/reward. The main risk is still structural leverage, which is unchanged, and T is already ~one\u2011third of equity. No fundamental reason to exit, but also no sufficient margin\u2011of\u2011safety improvement to warrant increasing an already large, debt\u2011heavy position.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price: $492.62 (entry ~$497.23), 52w: $454.60\u2013$542.07 (upper half, ~9% below high).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E 15.75; forward P/E 20.36 (noisy); P/B in dataset ~0.001 (known artefact, real P/B modest premium to book); P/S 2.86; EV/EBITDA not very meaningful for Berkshire\u2019s structure.\n- Quality: Profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55.\n- 1\u2011month action: Trades in a narrow high\u2011$490s/low\u2011$500s range with very low volatility; today\u2019s price at ~$493 fits that same band.\n- Interpretation: Still a high\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle at roughly fair value in a fair\u2011to\u2011expensive market.

Appropriate as our portfolio anchor; not compelling enough on valuation to add, and not overvalued enough to trim.\n\n4) Market & new ideas\n- Screen (US, market cap $0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u2265 8%) again returns mainly large, widely followed names: BRK\u2011B, JPM, CVX, PG, JNJ, HD, BAC, XOM, UNH, INTC, T, VZ, PFE, MMM, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST, TGT, LOW, DIS, NFLX, GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, etc.\n- Most of these (e.g., KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, COST) are excellent franchises but generally trade on high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/Es\u2014quality at full price, not obvious deep value.\n- Underfollowed tickers like CSWI and WBA continue to lack reliable data from the tools (key fields null or inconsistent), so they cannot be responsibly underwritten.\n- Verizon (VZ) remains a value\u2011ish peer: low P/E and high yield, but with even higher leverage and similar business risk to T, making it a lateral move rather than a superior opportunity. Adding it would just stack more U.S. telecom leverage without improving the portfolio\u2019s risk/return.\n- BRK\u2011B at ~16x earnings near the upper half of its 52\u2011week range, plus rich valuations across staples and mega\u2011cap tech, confirms that the broad U.S. large\u2011cap market is fair\u2011to\u2011expensive rather than distressed.\n\n5) Portfolio view\n- Using updated prices, equity in PFE, T, and BRK\u2011B is just under $9k versus $10k starting capital; with no executed trades historically, cash remains on the order of ~$1.0\u20131.1k (~10\u201312% of the portfolio).\n- Structure remains: PFE ~high\u201130s% (value + high yield in large\u2011cap pharma), T ~low\u201130s% (value + yield in leveraged telecom), BRK\u2011B ~high\u201120s% (quality compounder), plus ~10\u201312% cash.\n- No position appears overvalued or structurally impaired; all still offer reasonable to attractive value for their quality and risk. The current screening universe does not present a clearly superior, fully analyzable small/mid\u2011cap idea.\n- Consistent with a margin\u2011of\u2011safety, concentrated value approach, preserving current positions and cash is preferable to forced rotation or adding further to existing sector risks."
