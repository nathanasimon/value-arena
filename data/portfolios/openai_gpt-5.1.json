            "notes": "Key data and conclusions from today\u2019s research:\n\n1) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price: $497.23; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (trading ~8% below high, well above low).\n- Valuation/quality: TTM P/E \u2248 15.9; profit margin \u2248 18%; ROE \u2248 10%; ROA \u2248 4.8%; very strong balance sheet (current ratio ~2.7, conservative leverage).\n- 1\u2011year price history: Steady uptrend with moderate volatility; essentially a compounding vehicle that mirrors growth in intrinsic value.\n- Insider activity: Buffett\u2019s regular large stock gifts (charity) and minimal selling by other insiders; no negative signal.\n- Analyst stance: Light coverage; mix of Buy/Hold, no major red flags.\n- Interpretation: High\u2011quality, diversified compounding machine trading at a roughly fair (mid\u2011teens) multiple versus an expensive market. Not a screaming bargain but a robust, low\u2011risk core holding with implicit margin of safety via its underlying cash\u2011generative subsidiaries and large cash pile.\n\n2) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Price: $25.77; 52w range: $20.92\u2013$27.69.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 15.0; forward P/E \u2248 8.8; P/B \u2248 1.6; P/S \u2248 2.3; EV/EBITDA \u2248 8.0.\n- Profitability/quality: Profit margin \u2248 15.7%; ROE \u2248 10.6%; ROA \u2248 5.2%; debt\u2011to\u2011equity \u2248 66%; current ratio ~1.3. Solid, not over\u2011levered.\n- Dividend: Yield \u2248 6.6%, well\u2011covered by forward earnings based on the low forward P/E, though subject to drug-cycle volatility.\n- Price action (1y): Stock sank into low\u201120s amid post\u2011COVID revenue normalization concerns and has since recovered into mid\u201120s; still below prior cycle highs.\n- Insider activity: Many stock/option exercises (neutral), but notably a director purchased ~19,457 shares around $25.65 (~$0.5M) in Feb 2025, a positive alignment signal at roughly today\u2019s price.\n- Analyst recommendations: Recent consensus skewed to Hold/Buy (roughly 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell). Street sees value but with execution risk.\n- Thesis: Large, diversified pharma with durable cash flows trading at a single\u2011digit forward P/E and a >6% dividend yield. Market is pricing in a significant decline in COVID\u2011related earnings and pipeline/regulatory risk. Even under conservative assumptions for lower earnings, the combination of yield plus modest growth offers an attractive total\u2011return profile. Margin of safety comes from the low forward multiple, diversified portfolio, and balance sheet.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Price: $24.84; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 8.1; forward P/E \u2248 11.1; P/B \u2248 1.6; P/S \u2248 1.4; EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.6.\n- Profitability/quality: Profit margin \u2248 17.9%; ROE \u2248 19.1%; ROA \u2248 4.0%; debt\u2011to\u2011equity \u2248 124% (high but typical for telecom), current ratio \u2248 1.0, quick ratio \u2248 0.7.\n- Dividend: Yield \u2248 4.4%. Payout appears covered by earnings and free cash flow after prior reset, but leverage and capex requirements remain key risks.\n- Price action (1y): Strong recovery from low\u201120s to high\u201120s, then consolidation in mid\u201120s. Market is no longer in panic but still ascribes a low multiple versus market due to leverage and secular worries.\n- Insider activity: Recent stock awards to CEO/CFO/other execs around $24\u201326; no large open\u2011market selling; largely neutral to mildly positive.\n- Analyst recommendations: Currently 4 strong buy, 13 buy, 8 hold, no sells \u2013 a broadly constructive stance.\n- Thesis: Boring, cash\u2011flow\u2011heavy telecom that has de\u2011risked vs prior years (asset sales, dividend right\u2011sizing) yet still trades at a depressed earnings multiple. With even modest execution on deleveraging and steady wireless service revenue, investors are paid a mid\u2011single\u2011digit yield to wait, with potential for re\u2011rating toward a low\u2011teens multiple. Margin of safety comes from low valuation and recurring cash flows, offset by elevated debt risk.\n\nPortfolio & market context:\n- With BRK-B at a fair (not cheap) multiple, and PFE/T still on clear value multiples with income, a barbelled approach \u2013 one high\u2011quality compounding core plus two higher\u2011yield, more contrarian names \u2013 balances quality and upside.\n- Overall market, judging by BRK-B and JPM trading near highs at mid\u2011teens P/Es, appears fairly valued to expensive. The better risk/reward seems in specific underappreciated cash\u2011generative names rather than broad index\u2011like exposure."

            "notes": "Key updates as of 2025\u201112\u201111:\n\n1) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Price / performance: ~$25.78 vs our entry at $25.77 (roughly flat). Trading between its 52\u2011week low $20.92 and high $27.69, currently in the upper half but still below the recent spike highs.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 15.0; forward P/E \u2248 8.4; P/B \u2248 1.58; P/S \u2248 2.33; EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.9. Dividend yield \u2248 6.7%. These are essentially unchanged from our initial work and still imply the market is pricing in a significant earnings step\u2011down.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 15.7%, ROE \u2248 10.6%, ROA \u2248 5.2%. Debt\u2011to\u2011equity \u2248 66%, current ratio \u2248 1.28. No sign of new balance\u2011sheet stress.\n- Price action (1y): The chart shows a large leg down into the low\u201120s in spring 2025, then a strong grind higher into the mid\u201120s and a spike above $26 in October. Since then the stock has been consolidating in the mid\u201120s. That\u2019s consistent with the market digesting post\u2011COVID reset news rather than a fresh negative development.\n- Insider activity: Recent items are mostly option exercises and stock awards for executives, plus a small officer sale (~2,500 shares at ~$25.93). The notably positive February 2025 open\u2011market director purchase around $25.65 remains a strong reference point near today\u2019s price, and there\u2019s been no wave of selling around current levels.\n- Street sentiment: Latest recommendation snapshot is stable: 3 strong buy, 7 buy, 15 hold, 1 sell. No evidence of a sudden downgrade cycle.\n- Interpretation: Our original thesis (single\u2011digit forward P/E on a large, diversified pharma with a covered high yield) remains intact. The business and valuation profile are essentially unchanged, and the stock has merely churned around our entry. Margin of safety looks adequate; no reason to trim or add based solely on today\u2019s information.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price / performance: ~$24.39 vs our entry at $24.84 (down ~2%). 52\u2011week range $21.38\u2013$29.79; current price is well off the highs, closer to mid\u2011range.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 7.9; forward P/E \u2248 10.9; P/B \u2248 1.57; P/S \u2248 1.40; EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.46. Dividend yield \u2248 4.6%. Still a classic low\u2011multiple, income\u2011oriented telecom profile.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 17.9%, ROE \u2248 19.1%, ROA \u2248 4.0%. Debt\u2011to\u2011equity remains high at \u2248124%, with current ratio \u22481.0 and quick ratio \u22480.71. This is consistent with our prior work: leverage is elevated but not newly alarming.\n- Price action (1y): Strong rally from low\u201120s to high\u201120s through mid\u2011year, followed by a pullback into the mid\u201120s and then a further drift down to the mid\u2011$24s recently. The move down from ~29 suggests optimism cooled, but the stock is not in a new panic phase.\n- Insider activity: Recent transactions are largely stock awards and gifts to executives at prices in the mid\u201120s. No big open\u2011market insider selling. That\u2019s neutral to mildly positive (compensation aligned near today\u2019s price level).\n- Street sentiment: Very constructive: 4 strong buy, 13 buy, 8 hold, 0 sell. This pattern is unchanged month\u2011over\u2011month.\n- Interpretation: T still offers an 8x trailing / low\u2011teens forward P/E on a stable, capital\u2011intensive business with a right\u2011sized dividend. The share price has eased a bit since our entry but not enough to justify materially increasing an already sizeable telecom allocation. Thesis (stable cash flows + deleveraging + potential modest re\u2011rating) remains intact; risk still centered on leverage rather than valuation.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price / performance: ~$490.43 vs our entry at $497.23 (down ~1\u20132%). 52\u2011week range $440.10\u2013$542.07; current price is slightly below the mid\u2011point of that range and ~10% below the high.\n- Valuation: TTM P/E \u2248 15.7; forward P/E \u2248 20.3 (the latter is noisy given the nature of reported earnings). P/S \u2248 2.84. P/B is reported around 0.001 due to accounting quirks in the dataset, but we know from prior analysis that Berkshire typically trades at a modest premium to book. EV/EBITDA is not meaningful because of the conglomerate structure and large cash/marketable securities position.\n- Quality / balance sheet: Profit margin \u2248 18%, ROE \u2248 10.2%, ROA \u2248 4.8%. Current ratio \u2248 2.7 with very low debt\u2011to\u2011equity \u224818%. This is still a fortress balance sheet.\n- Price action (1y): A steady climb into the low\u2011500s, a spike to all\u2011time highs above $540 in May, then a pullback into the high\u2011400s/low\u2011500s where it\u2019s been trading in a relatively tight range. No sign of structural breakdown; just consolidation after a strong run.\n- Insider activity: As usual, activity is dominated by Warren Buffett\u2019s large recurring stock gifts to charities and board members; Ajit Jain has some occasional sales and small gifts. No insider buys, but this is longstanding behavior and not new information.\n- Street sentiment: Light coverage: current snapshot shows 0 strong buys, 2 buys, 2 holds, 0 sells. Analysts broadly see Berkshire as a high\u2011quality, fairly\u2011valued compounder.\n- Interpretation: Berkshire still looks like a high\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle trading at roughly a fair multiple in a market that is not obviously cheap. It remains appropriate as our quality anchor rather than a deep value opportunity.\n\n4) Portfolio & market context\n- Portfolio structure (approximate): PFE ~$3.5k, T ~$2.95k, BRK\u2011B ~$2.47k, plus roughly ~$1k cash based on our initial allocations. That\u2019s a concentrated three\u2011stock portfolio with meaningful exposure to healthcare (PFE), telecom/infrastructure (T), and a diversified conglomerate (BRK\u2011B).\n- Relative valuations: PFE and T continue to trade on clear value multiples vs. the overall market (single\u2011digit to low\u2011teens forward P/Es and high, covered yields). Berkshire, at ~16x trailing earnings near mid\u2011range of its 52\u2011week band, suggests the broad large\u2011cap market is priced at fair to somewhat rich levels rather than distressed.\n- No new red\u2011flag developments: Across the three names, fundamentals, insider behavior, and analyst stance show stability. Recent price moves are modest and consistent with normal volatility.\n- Cash as optionality: With the market broadly at fair valuations and no new, thoroughly\u2011researched high\u2011conviction idea in hand today, it is rational within a value\u2011investing framework to keep the residual cash uncommitted and wait for a more obvious dislocation.\n"

No sign of thesis\u2011changing news.\n- Assessment: Large, diversified pharma still priced at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a ~6.7% dividend yield and stable fundamentals. Thesis and margin of safety remain intact; sizing is already meaningful, so we hold but don\u2019t add on a flat tape.\n\n2) AT&T (T)\n- Price: ~$24.30; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79 (well below the high, modestly above the low).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E ~7.9; forward P/E ~10.9; P/B ~1.56; P/S ~1.40; EV/EBITDA ~7.45; dividend yield ~4.6%.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~17.9%; ROE ~19.1%; ROA ~4.0%. Leverage still high: debt/equity ~124%; current ratio ~1.01; quick ~0.71.\n- 1\u2011month price action: Drift from mid\u2011$25s down into the low\u2011$24s; a mild pullback rather than a capitulation.\n- Insider/Street: Recent activity mostly stock awards and stock gifts at prices around mid\u201120s; no notable insider selling. Analyst consensus still very favorable (4 strong buy, 13 buy, 8 hold, no sells).\n- Assessment: Remains a classic low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011generative but leveraged telecom. Our existing position size is substantial; current pullback is not large enough versus risk (leverage) to justify increasing exposure. Thesis unchanged; continue to hold.\n\n3) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n- Price: ~$495.85; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (around the middle of the range).\n- Valuation: TTM P/E ~15.8; forward P/E ~20.5 (noisy); P/S ~2.87; EV/EBITDA metric is not very meaningful due to the conglomerate structure and large cash/securities portfolio.\n- Quality & balance sheet: Profit margin ~18.1%; ROE ~10.2%; ROA ~4.8%; debt/equity ~18.2%; current ratio ~2.72; quick ~2.55. This remains a very strong balance sheet.\n- 1\u2011month price action: Gradual softening from low\u2011$510s to high\u2011$490s, with no sharp breaks.\n- Insider/Street: As usual, insider tape shows Buffett\u2019s periodic large stock gifts and small Ajit Jain sales earlier in the year; nothing new and out of pattern. Analyst coverage is light and stable (roughly 2 buys, 2 holds).\n- Assessment: High\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle trading at a fair \u2013 but not obviously cheap \u2013 multiple. Still appropriate as our portfolio\u2019s quality anchor; not compelling enough on valuation to increase.\n\n4) New idea scan & market color\n- Screened for US stocks with market cap roughly mid/small, P/E 3\u201312, and ROE >=8. Returned a mix of large, widely\u2011followed names (e.g., PG, KO, PEP, MCD, WMT, XOM, JPM, BRK-B), plus existing positions (PFE, T) and some other value\u2011tilted names (VZ, MMM, WBA, etc.). This suggests the opportunity set is not overflowing with clearly mispriced quality small caps under our simple filters.\n- WBA: Tool returned nulls for price and ratios today, limiting our ability to analyze it quantitatively in this framework.\n- MMM: Current data show price ~$168.6, near a 52w high of ~$174.7; TTM P/E ~26.9, forward P/E ~19.5, P/B ~19.4, EV/EBITDA ~15.8, dividend yield ~1.7%. That profile is more \u2018quality at a full price\u2019 than \u2018value with margin of safety\u2019, especially given known legal/legacy overhangs.\n- Market proxy via BRK\u2011B and MMM: A high\u2011quality conglomerate at ~16x earnings and an industrial blue chip at high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/E both near the mid\u2011to\u2011upper parts of their ranges indicate a broadly fair\u2011to\u2011expensive large\u2011cap market rather than a deep value environment.\n\n5) Portfolio positioning takeaways\n- Three\u2011stock core remains: PFE (value + yield in healthcare), T (value + yield in telecom), BRK-B (quality compounder anchor).\n- Estimated cash of about 10% (given $10k start and current equity values) provides optionality.\n- No position shows fundamental deterioration or a valuation that has become obviously stretched on the upside.\n- No newly identified candidate today offers a clearly better risk/reward or larger margin of safety than our current holdings at current prices.\n\nConclusion: Maintain all three positions and keep cash uncommitted for now, consistent with a patient, margin\u2011of\u2011safety\u2011driven value approach."

Prior NAV (2025\u201112\u201115) \u2248 $9,991, implying cash \u2248 $900\u2013950 (~9% of portfolio). Exact cash is uncertain due to portfolio\u2011tool authorization error, but order of magnitude is clear.\n\n2) Pfizer (PFE)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: $26.43; 52w range: $20.92\u2013$27.69 (upper half, still below high).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E \u2248 15.4; forward P/E \u2248 8.9.\n  \u2022 P/B \u2248 1.62; P/S \u2248 2.39; EV/EBITDA \u2248 8.1.\n  \u2022 Dividend yield \u2248 6.5%.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin \u2248 15.7%; ROE \u2248 10.6%; ROA \u2248 5.2%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity \u2248 66.5%; current ratio \u2248 1.28; quick ratio \u2248 0.90.\n  \u2192 Still a solid, moderately levered large\u2011cap pharma.\n- Recent price action (1 month):\n  \u2022 Traded mostly in the mid\u2011$25s to low\u2011$26s, with a grind higher and a close at $26.43.\n  \u2022 No sharp breakdowns or spikes tied to obvious negative/positive events in the last month.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 Tape is dominated by stock awards and option exercises by executives.\n  \u2022 One small officer sale (~2,500 shares @ ~$25.93) and numerous derivative exercises at higher strike prices (\u2248$30\u201331), not alarming given typical comp structures.\n  \u2022 Previously noted open\u2011market director buy (~19,457 shares @ ~$25.65, ~$0.5M) remains a strong positive signal near current price.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Latest recs: strong buy 3, buy 7, hold 15, sell 1 (stable vs prior months).\n  \u2192 Street sees value with execution risk; no downgrade wave.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: large, diversified pharma at single\u2011digit forward P/E with a covered ~6.5\u20137% yield, with earnings depressed by post\u2011COVID normalization but long\u2011term cash generation intact.\n  \u2022 Today, valuation, profitability, balance sheet, and sentiment are essentially unchanged; price is modestly above our entry (~$25.77), but still clearly in \u201cvalue\u201d territory relative to quality.\n  \u2192 Thesis and margin of safety remain intact. Not expensive enough to trim, not cheap enough (relative to our existing size) to justify materially adding.\n\n3) AT&T (T)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: $24.31; 52w range: $21.38\u2013$29.79 (well below high, closer to middle of range).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E \u2248 7.9; forward P/E \u2248 10.9.\n  \u2022 P/B \u2248 1.56; P/S \u2248 1.40; EV/EBITDA \u2248 7.45.\n  \u2022 Dividend yield \u2248 4.6%.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin \u2248 17.9%; ROE \u2248 19.1%; ROA \u2248 4.0%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity \u2248 124%; current ratio \u2248 1.01; quick ratio \u2248 0.71.\n  \u2192 Classic leveraged telecom: strong recurring cash flows but high leverage and ongoing capex needs.\n- Recent price action (1 month):\n  \u2022 Drifted from mid\u2011$25s into low\u2011$24s; a controlled pullback, not a capitulation.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 Numerous stock awards to CEO/CFO/other executives at prices around $24.75\u2013$26.02.\n  \u2022 Some stock gifts from senior executives; no notable open\u2011market selling.\n  \u2192 Neutral to mildly positive; comp aligned near today\u2019s prices.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Latest recs: strong buy 4, buy 12, hold 9, no sells. Slight shift from 13 to 12 buys vs prior month, but still broadly constructive.\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: low\u2011multiple, cash\u2011generative wireline/wireless business with right\u2011sized dividend, where modest deleveraging plus stable cash flows can yield attractive income and potential multiple expansion from an 8x earnings base.\n  \u2022 Today, metrics are nearly unchanged; price is modestly below our entry (~$24.84), but not at a dramatically better bargain level.\n  \u2022 Key risk (leverage) remains, but there\u2019s no new fundamental deterioration evident in these tools.\n  \u2192 Thesis holds. Given existing meaningful position, risk from adding (concentrated exposure to a highly leveraged telecom) is not justified by only a modest discount vs our entry.\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\u2011B)\n- Price & valuation (today):\n  \u2022 Price: $506.38; 52w range: $440.10\u2013$542.07 (around the middle but closer to upper half).\n  \u2022 TTM P/E \u2248 16.2; forward P/E \u2248 20.9 (noisy, given conglomerate accounting).\n  \u2022 P/S \u2248 2.94; P/B in dataset is distorted by accounting quirks, but qualitatively Berkshire usually trades at a modest premium to book.\n  \u2022 No dividend; total return via compounding of intrinsic value and buybacks.\n- Quality & balance sheet:\n  \u2022 Profit margin \u2248 18.1%; ROE \u2248 10.2%; ROA \u2248 4.8%.\n  \u2022 Debt/equity \u2248 18.2%; current ratio \u2248 2.72; quick \u2248 2.55.\n  \u2192 Fortress balance sheet and high\u2011quality, diversified earnings base.\n- Recent price action (1 month):\n  \u2022 Traded mostly in the high $490s to low $500s; modest recovery from sub\u2011$500 levels, but still below the $542 high.\n- Insider activity:\n  \u2022 Warren Buffett continues his regular large stock gifts to charities (multi\u2011million\u2011share gifts at $0 value in filings) \u2013 longstanding pattern.\n  \u2022 Ajit Jain occasional small stock gifts and an earlier sale (~15,000 shares @ ~$500 and 2,000 @ ~$465 in prior months).\n  \u2192 No unusual insider buying or selling; behavior consistent with long\u2011term patterns.\n- Street sentiment:\n  \u2022 Recs: strong buy 0, buy 2, hold 2, sell 0 (light coverage, stable vs prior months).\n- Thesis check:\n  \u2022 Original thesis: high\u2011quality, diversified compounding machine at a fair mid\u2011teens P/E, serving as portfolio\u2019s quality anchor and implicit market proxy in a fairly\u2011to\u2011fully valued market.\n  \u2022 Today\u2019s valuation (~16x) and position in the 52w range still look like \u201cfair value\u201d rather than a screaming bargain or bubble.\n  \u2192 Continue to hold as a core, low\u2011risk anchor; not cheap enough to justify overweighting.\n\n5) Market conditions & new idea scan\n- Market read via BRK\u2011B and screened names:\n  \u2022 Berkshire at ~16x earnings in the mid\u2011upper part of its 52w range suggests a broad large\u2011cap market that is fairly to somewhat richly valued, not distressed.\n  \u2022 Our value screen (US, market cap $0.5\u201320B, P/E 3\u201312, ROE \u22658) again surfaced a mix of large, well\u2011known names and a few others: [\"CSWI\", \"BRK\u2011B\", \"JPM\", \"CVX\", \"PG\", \"JNJ\", \"HD\", \"BAC\", \"XOM\", \"UNH\", \"INTC\", \"T\", \"VZ\", \"PFE\", \"WBA\", \"MMM\", \"KO\", \"PEP\", \"MCD\", \"WMT\", \"COST\", \"TGT\", \"LOW\", \"DIS\", \"NFLX\"].\n  \u2022 Many of these are quality franchises but are broadly followed and, in most cases, not obvious deep\u2011value outliers at today\u2019s prices.\n- Attempted new idea: CSWI (CSW Industrials)\n  \u2022 Tools returned null/empty data for price, ratios, financials, price history, insider activity, and recommendations.\n  \u2022 Without reliable basic data, I cannot responsibly underwrite a value thesis or size a position.\n- Other screened ideas:\n  \u2022 MMM: previously checked; currently trades near 52w highs on a high\u2011teens to mid\u201120s P/E, with known legal/legacy risks \u2013 more \u201cquality at a full price\u201d than a margin\u2011of\u2011safety value idea.\n  \u2022 WBA: earlier data were incomplete/erratic; current tools again show issues for some tickers, limiting comfort.\n  \u2022 VZ: telecom peer to T; also value\u2011ish, but adding would further concentrate us in leveraged U.S. telecom without clearly superior risk/return vs T.\n  \u2192 Net: Today\u2019s screen doesn\u2019t reveal a clearly superior, under\u2011followed small/mid\u2011cap value idea with sufficient data to justify deployment of our ~9% cash.\n\n6) Portfolio positioning conclusions\n- PFE: still a large, diversified pharma at a single\u2011digit forward P/E with a ~6.5% covered yield, modestly above our entry but firmly in value territory. Fundamentals and sentiment stable; insider behavior benign. Hold.\n- T: low\u2011P/E, high\u2011yield telecom with elevated leverage but stable cash flows. Price a bit below our entry, but not enough margin of safety to justify further concentration. Hold.\n- BRK\u2011B: high\u2011quality, diversified compounding vehicle at a fair ~16x multiple. Ideal quality anchor; not a deep value candidate for additional buying. Hold.\n- Cash (~9%): With no new name clearly superior to our existing holdings or clearly mispriced today, cash remains valuable optionality. Within a value\u2011investing framework, it is better to wait for a fat pitch than to dilute portfolio quality and margin of safety.\n\nDecision: No changes to existing positions today and no new positions initiated. Continue to monitor for dislocations, particularly in smaller, less\u2011followed names once reliable data are available."
